Kay Wilson is in the news because The Daily Mail has an extenstive write-up on her story, and how the terrorists who butchered her are being paid by the Palestinian Authority while in prison, a common benefit bestowed on those who murder or maim Jews.The Daily Mail story is titled You pay two Palestinian terrorists who left this British woman for dead and killed her friend £9,000 each every year – as a ‘REWARD’ :

Two Palestinian terrorists who repeatedly stabbed a British woman in a brutal attack and killed her friend are now each receiving at least £9,000 in ‘blood money’ every year with the help of UK aid.Kay Wilson was left for dead in an orgy of violence in Jerusalem in which Kristine Luken, an American, was killed.Ms Wilson, 51, and her friend were hiking in the Judean Hills in 2010 when the two men pounced on them, believing both women to be Jewish, although Miss Luken was Christian.With the release of The Daily Mail story, she made sure to point out that she was saved by an Arab Israeli surgeon:

Wilson recently told her story outside the United Nations, as hideous anti-Israel propaganda and resolutions were debated and passed by the ill-named U.N. Human Rights Council:A 12-year-old Muslim boy accused his teacher of targeting him for his religion by calling him a “terrorist” in front of his peers in the US state of Texas, prompting school authorities to probe the incident.Waleed Abushaaban, a 7th grade student in First Colony Middle School has been the butt of “bomb” jokes and ridicule from his fellow classmates after his teacher made the careless crack, a local TV KHOU.com reported.The teacher allegedly made the comment when her class had been watching the movie “Bend it Like Beckham” after taking an exam and Waleed let out a loud laugh at a joke in the movie.The English and Language Arts teacher was immediately removed from the classroom after the accusations and Waleed’s family wants the school to sack her.The school has removed the English and Language Arts teacher from the classroom while it investigates; however, Waleed’s family want her permanently dismissed.The autopsy conducted on the body of Arab terrorist Abd al-Fatah al-Sharif on Sunday confirmed that he was still alive before the Kfir Brigade medic shot a bullet at his head.Arab pathologist Rayan al-Ali, who was allowed to observe the autopsy, told the Arab press: “The results of the autopsy were expected.A court order by the Israeli Supreme Court Thursday denied an appeal by the terrorist’s family to allow an Arab doctor to take part directly in the autopsy.But the court granted permission for al-Ali to attend and take notes of the autopsy.The autopsy was conducted as part of an investigation being carried out by the IDF prosecutor to determine if the terrorist was killed by the initial gunshots that incapacitated him or by the final bullet that was fired at his head by the medic.The Israeli and Palestinian pathologists ruled that the bullet shot by the soldier documented shooting already-neutralized terrorist Abed al Fatah a-Sharif was what caused the former’s death and not the bullets shot at him during the attack in Hebron, officials involved in the investigations claimed Sunday.A military judge decided on Friday to uphold a previous ruling to release the Kfir Brigade soldier to a five-day open detention, rejecting an appeal of the decision by the Military Advocate General's Office.The military prosecution argued against the decision, saying that he is not cooperating with investigators.Chief military prosecutor Col. Sharon Zagagi-Pinhas said that "the evidence present a very clear picture of what happened, which bases the suspicions against him."Col. Zagagi-Pinhas went on to say that "the soldier claimed several times during the investigation that the terrorist tried to reach for a knife that was 'within reach' of him, while the documentation in the video presents a different situation, in which the knife was a significant distance away from the terrorist, who was in serious condition as it is."Photo via CeFaan Kim of ABC7NY

CAIRO (AP) — The Arab League on Friday formally branded Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization, a move that raises concerns of deepening divisions among Arab countries and ramps up the pressure on the Shiite group, which is fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.The move aligns the 22-member league firmly behind Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, which made the same formal branding against Hezbollah on March 2.Earlier in the day, the Saudi delegation stormed out of a league meeting in protest over a speech by Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari hailing Hezbollah and Shiite militias as "resistant movements."The decision by the Arab League is a significant blow to Hezbollah and it is also likely to further aggravate tensions in Lebanon, undermining the country's delicate political balance amid fierce political infighting between groups loyal to Hezbollah and Saudi-backed factions.CAIRO (AP) — The Arab League on Friday formally branded Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization, a move that raises concerns of deepening divisions among Arab countries and ramps up the pressure on the Shiite group, which is fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.The move aligns the 22-member league firmly behind Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, which made the same formal branding against Hezbollah on March 2.Earlier in the day, the Saudi delegation stormed out of a league meeting in protest over a speech by Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari hailing Hezbollah and Shiite militias as "resistant movements."The decision by the Arab League is a significant blow to Hezbollah and it is also likely to further aggravate tensions in Lebanon, undermining the country's delicate political balance amid fierce political infighting between groups loyal to Hezbollah and Saudi-backed factions.The league's decision also reflects deep regional divisions between Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shiite powerhouse Iran, Hezbollah's patron.The EU still allows Hezbollah’s “political wing” to operate in Europe

Amid renewed tensions between Iran and the Sunni Arab States, the six member Gulf Cooperation Council has declared Iranian-backed Hezbollah a terrorist organisation.Since 1980s, Iran has been exercising control over Lebanon through its proxy Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist military outfit.Jerusalem Post reports:

The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council named Hezbollah a terrorist organization on Wednesday, opening up the possibility of further sanctions against the Iran-allied group that wields influence in Lebanon and fights in Syria.“Until now, the Saudis had only designated individual operatives and Hezbollah’s Saudi branch as a terrorist organization, not its Lebanese core,” David Andrew Weinberg, a specialist on Gulf affairs and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Jerusalem Post.So far, the EU has only outlawed the terrorist group’s “military wing,” allowing Hezbollah to operate inside Europe with impunity.The decision comes against the backdrop of the recent crisis between Saudi Arabia and Lebanon in which Saudi Arabia has decided to stop

the transfer of security assistance to the Lebanese army and Lebanese security forces following the increasing influence of Hezbollah in state institutions.Such declarations regarding Hezbollah have been made in the past, but the decision now to define Hezbollah as a terrorist organization is designed to give the Gulf states more leeway against Hezbollah, as now they will be able to act more aggressively against it since given it is officially defined as a terrorist organization.Saudi Arabia periodically imposes sanctions on companies and individuals associated with Hezbollah, and it is likely that after this decision this activity will increase.Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah Tuesday called on his supporters to not be dragged into violence as those who would profit would be Israel and Saudi Arabia.In a speech on TV Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia of stepping to a low level with the broadcast on Saudi TV last week of a parody of himself, and teased the Saudis currently at war in Yemen saying that "Yemenis are the most deprived people in the world - more than the Palestinians'.A disabled San Francisco man bumped up against the war on terror after his bank put a hold on an online payment  to his dogwalker thinking his dog was a terrorist group.Bruce Francis, who has a form of multiple sclerosis, told KTVU that he was trying to pay his dogwalker online using Chase Bank only to have the bank put a hold on the funds.According to Francis he put the dog’s name in the memo line, setting off bells at the bank, which then alerted the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Notified by his dogwalker that said she had not received payment, Francis checked with his bank which referred him to OFAC for an explanation.“The Treasury Department official said ‘Yes, your instinct is right, your dogs name is similar to that of a terrorist organization,'” Francis recalled.to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist entity cleared the House Judiciary Committee today.Not more than 60 days after enactment of the bill, the State Department would have to submit a report to Congress on whether the Muslims Brotherhood meets the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization -- and if not, explain why not.The chairman stressed that under the designation "this administration would actually have to deny admittance to aliens tied to the Muslim Brotherhood rather than continue to proclaim to the world that the Brotherhood is a moderate and secular organization.""The United States must recognize and sanction the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization as part of our national security strategy.""We are deeply troubled by the politically motivated sentences that have been handed down against former President Morsi and several others," White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters last June after the deposed Muslim Brotherhood leader was sentenced to life in prison.Boko Haram is as if not more deadly than ISIS.This is reflected in policy as well, with far more political attention paid to ISIS than Boko Haram.While the mainstream media response about this tragedy has been underwhelming, the added calamity lies in how the Obama administration has seemingly neglected to treat Boko Haram and the victims of their maniacal violence with the same resources and attention that has been provided to ISIS and victims throughout Europe.-Boko Haram burns kids alive in Nigeria-

Yet the continual slaughter of innocent Africans has not elicited an equal response from the nation or from the Obama Administration, when in fact Boko Haram is the most deadly Islamic terror group on Earth.In 2014, Boko Haram killed 6,664 people, while ISIS was responsible for 6,073 deaths.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks that rattled Brussels on Tuesday.Last Friday, Belgian authorities arrested Salah Adeslam, one of the primary suspects in the November Paris terrorist attacks, who was hiding in the Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels.French President Francois Hollande remarked, “Through the Brussels attacks, it is the whole of Europe that is hit.”[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Paris Attacks]

Adam Nossiter of The New York Times finds that the Brussels attacks do not point just to security concerns within Belgium but more broadly reveal the “enduring vulnerability of Europe to terrorism.”Regarding the impact of the Brussels attacks on American politics, Ben Geier at Fortune thinks that the discourse of the 2016 presidential election will now move away from domestic and economic issues, benefitting Republican candidates.In late February, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation along party lines calling on the State Department to designate the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt a foreign terrorist organization."The Brotherhood is not, factually speaking, a terrorist group," said Shadi Hamid, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of "Islamic Exceptionalism: How the Struggle over Islam is Reshaping the Modern World."Gen. Sisi, along with U.S. allies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and imprisoned thousands of its members.As a result, the Islamic State group considers members of the Muslim Brotherhood to be apostates.The impact of the U.S. labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group goes beyond mere partisan politics.• EU and Turkey agree on deal • Watered down plans include request for UN help • Second day of summit includes Ahmet Davutoglu • Davutoglu: It's a humanitarian rather than bargaining issue • Erdogan: Europe needs to look at own record on migrants • Where did it all go wrong for Turkey?Last week EU and Turkish leaders met at a European Council summit to discuss a plan to solve the migrant crisis as thousands of refugees continue to make their way from Turkey to Greece.The proposals were thought up by Mrs Merkel and Mr Davutoglu the night before unbeknownst to European Council president Donald Tusk and other EU leaders and presented on the day as new demands from Ankara.The EU and Ankara have agreed on the outlines of a deal on Friday to stop migrants coming to Europe via Turkey by returning all those in Greece to Turkey from Sunday.Tense talks began on Thursday between EU leaders at the European Council summit as the Belgian prime minister expressed concerns that Ankara is blackmailing Europe.SACRAMENTO (CBS) — An Iraqi-born Sacramento man who allegedly lied to federal investigators about traveling to Syria between 2013 and 2104 has been charged with providing support to terrorists.A complaint filed on January 6, 2016 against Al-Jayab, described as a Palestinian born in Iraq who came to the United States as an Iraqi refugee in October 2012, alleges that “the defendant traveled to Syria to take up arms with terrorist organizations and concealed that conduct from immigration authorities.”The complaint also alleges that he communicated on social media with others about his intent to return to Syria to fight for terrorist organizations.Read Also: Sacramento Man Pleads Not Guilty To Lying About Syria Trip

Analysis of IP addresses and other information established that Al-Jayab accessed the Internet via a satellite that covered both eastern Turkey and areas of northern Syria during his travels abroad over the winter of 2013-2014, according to the complaint.Al-Jayab allegedly lied about traveling to Syria to fight against the Syrian government, according to the complaint.Lebanon-based Hezbollah is paying an increasingly high price for its loyalty to Iran; on Friday, the Arab League joined other world leaders in a formal vote declaring the Iranian proxy a terrorist entity.“We decided to label Hezbollah a terrorist group in accordance with a project submitted by the United Arab Emirates regarding Iranian interference in the Arab region,” Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Ahmad Bin Hali said in a statement.The tiny island kingdom of Bahrain, a member of the GCC and the Arab League, was the first Arab nation to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist entity in March 2013.Hezbollah is listed as a terrorist organization in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel.Shortly after the GCC’s decision to label the Lebanese organization a terrorist group, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah slammed the Gulf Arab countries’ decision.On Friday, March 11, 2016, Egypt’s state news agency says the Arab League has formally branded Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization.(AP Photo Ahmed Omar, File)

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations formally branded Hezbollah a terrorist organization on Wednesday, ramping up the pressure on the Lebanese militant group fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.Saudi Arabia in 2014 designated a Saudi affiliate of Hezbollah a terrorist group along with the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Yemen's Shiite Houthis and other groups.The GCC announcement came a few hours after a televised speech by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in which he harshly criticized Saudi Arabia for punitive measures that targeted Lebanon recently, including the halt in aid and Gulf travel warnings."Who gives Saudi Arabia the right to punish Lebanon and its army and Lebanese people living in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf just because Hezbollah is speaking out?This is a Techmeme archive page.It shows how the site appeared at 1:05 AM ET, March 7, 2016.The most current version of the site as always is available at our home page.Libertarian Congressman Justin Amash has endorsed Ted Cruz, calling him a "principled defender of the Constitution."But Cruz has arguably proposed the most unconstitutional piece of legislation ever that, under the guise of preventing 12 ISIS fighters from returning to the country, will assualt the citizenship rights of all Americans.In fact, the bill, called the Expatriate Terrorist Act, will "expatriate" terrorists less and ordinary Americans more.That's why Sen.
