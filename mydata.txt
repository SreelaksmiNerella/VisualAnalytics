Switzerland has suspended the citizenship applications for the family of two Muslim teenagers, after they refused to shake hands with their female teachers.The boys’ refusal to shake hands with their female teachers garnered national attention in April, when the local school board decided to exempt them from the mandatory Swiss tradition.Students line up to shake hands with their teachers as a showing of mutual respect, but the boys said physical contact with women they are not related to violates their religious beliefs as Muslims.(RELATED: Swiss Muslim Students Exempt From Shaking Hands With Female Teachers)

The decision immediately caused an outcry around the country.A spokesman for the local canton — the equivalent of a state —  Tuesday said the boys’ families have now had their citizenship applications suspended.Members of the Muslim community asked Tuesday for more time to digest an agreement aimed at preventing illegal surveillance by the New York Police Department, saying they want to use the Ramadan season starting in early June to spread word among people still traumatized by police surveillance conducted since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight seemed receptive to delaying until mid-summer a decision on whether to approve the latest version of restrictions on surveillance agreed to by lawyers for plaintiffs in two lawsuits and the city.He asked lawyers to tell him Wednesday their reactions to numerous Muslim residents and others who said most Muslims in the city know little or nothing about the latest rules to emerge from a 1971 lawsuit that challenged surveillance of war protesters in the 1960s and '70s.A civilian representative appointed by the mayor, would attend monthly meetings of police officials and NYPD lawyers who review the investigations and would have authority to report suspected violations of the agreement to City Hall or a federal judge.New guideline restrictions were announced in January after The Associated Press revealed that New York City police spied on Muslims, infiltrated student groups and sent informants to mosques.Texas Senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz refused to meet with a Muslim delegation from his home state on Monday, snubbing the group during Muslim Advocacy Day.According to the Religion News Service (RNS), a group of 14 Texas Muslims visited Cruz’s senate office on April 18, hoping to speak with him or a staff member about their concerns as constituents in the Lone Star State.But after weeks of rejections from Cruz’s office, the senator’s staff once again declined the offer to meet with Muslims, even though Texas is home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the country.“We are quite disappointed to see a presidential candidate refuse to meet with constituents from his own state,” Oussama Jammal, secretary general of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO) which organized the delegation, told RNS.The group flew to Washington as part of Muslim Advocacy Day, a massive lobbying effort organized each year by the USCMO, an umbrella organization that represents several American Islamic groups.The prime minister of Belgium confirmed an accusation made by one of his ministers that in the wake of the deadly Brussels bombing carried out by ISIS-affiliated terrorists, some Belgian Muslim celebrated in the streets.Interior Minister Jan Jambon claimed in an interview with Flemish paper De Standaard that “a significant section of the Muslim community danced when attacks took place… They threw stones and bottles at police and press during the arrest of [accused terrorist] Salah Abdeslam.The comments drew criticism, and naturally drew comparisons with American presidential candidate Donald Trump‘s oft-repeated claim that New Jersey Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks.But unlike Trump, Jambon’s claim was at least partially backed by Prime Minister Charles Michel.“I confirm that there have been expressions of support for the attacks,”  Michel said in a statement.What had happened was: Monday, the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO) hosted a to-do in Washington called the National Muslim Advocacy Day, for the second year in a row.Let’s read his very stupid column in The Hill about how Monday’s event was ACTUALLY Muslim Brotherhood Appreciation Day:

Uh oh!You see, there is a memo, written by a Muslim Brotherhood dude, and it says exactly how groups like the USCMO are going to infiltrate America and turn it into the caliphate and kill America dead.This, according to Gaffney, is their plan:
