Kay Wilson is in the news because The Daily Mail has an extenstive write-up on her story, and how the terrorists who butchered her are being paid by the Palestinian Authority while in prison, a common benefit bestowed on those who murder or maim Jews.The Daily Mail story is titled You pay two Palestinian terrorists who left this British woman for dead and killed her friend £9,000 each every year – as a ‘REWARD’ :

Two Palestinian terrorists who repeatedly stabbed a British woman in a brutal attack and killed her friend are now each receiving at least £9,000 in ‘blood money’ every year with the help of UK aid.Kay Wilson was left for dead in an orgy of violence in Jerusalem in which Kristine Luken, an American, was killed.Ms Wilson, 51, and her friend were hiking in the Judean Hills in 2010 when the two men pounced on them, believing both women to be Jewish, although Miss Luken was Christian.With the release of The Daily Mail story, she made sure to point out that she was saved by an Arab Israeli surgeon:

Wilson recently told her story outside the United Nations, as hideous anti-Israel propaganda and resolutions were debated and passed by the ill-named U.N. Human Rights Council:A 12-year-old Muslim boy accused his teacher of targeting him for his religion by calling him a “terrorist” in front of his peers in the US state of Texas, prompting school authorities to probe the incident.Waleed Abushaaban, a 7th grade student in First Colony Middle School has been the butt of “bomb” jokes and ridicule from his fellow classmates after his teacher made the careless crack, a local TV KHOU.com reported.The teacher allegedly made the comment when her class had been watching the movie “Bend it Like Beckham” after taking an exam and Waleed let out a loud laugh at a joke in the movie.The English and Language Arts teacher was immediately removed from the classroom after the accusations and Waleed’s family wants the school to sack her.The school has removed the English and Language Arts teacher from the classroom while it investigates; however, Waleed’s family want her permanently dismissed.The autopsy conducted on the body of Arab terrorist Abd al-Fatah al-Sharif on Sunday confirmed that he was still alive before the Kfir Brigade medic shot a bullet at his head.Arab pathologist Rayan al-Ali, who was allowed to observe the autopsy, told the Arab press: “The results of the autopsy were expected.A court order by the Israeli Supreme Court Thursday denied an appeal by the terrorist’s family to allow an Arab doctor to take part directly in the autopsy.But the court granted permission for al-Ali to attend and take notes of the autopsy.The autopsy was conducted as part of an investigation being carried out by the IDF prosecutor to determine if the terrorist was killed by the initial gunshots that incapacitated him or by the final bullet that was fired at his head by the medic.The Israeli and Palestinian pathologists ruled that the bullet shot by the soldier documented shooting already-neutralized terrorist Abed al Fatah a-Sharif was what caused the former’s death and not the bullets shot at him during the attack in Hebron, officials involved in the investigations claimed Sunday.A military judge decided on Friday to uphold a previous ruling to release the Kfir Brigade soldier to a five-day open detention, rejecting an appeal of the decision by the Military Advocate General's Office.The military prosecution argued against the decision, saying that he is not cooperating with investigators.Chief military prosecutor Col. Sharon Zagagi-Pinhas said that "the evidence present a very clear picture of what happened, which bases the suspicions against him."Col. Zagagi-Pinhas went on to say that "the soldier claimed several times during the investigation that the terrorist tried to reach for a knife that was 'within reach' of him, while the documentation in the video presents a different situation, in which the knife was a significant distance away from the terrorist, who was in serious condition as it is."Photo via CeFaan Kim of ABC7NY

CAIRO (AP) — The Arab League on Friday formally branded Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization, a move that raises concerns of deepening divisions among Arab countries and ramps up the pressure on the Shiite group, which is fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.The move aligns the 22-member league firmly behind Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, which made the same formal branding against Hezbollah on March 2.Earlier in the day, the Saudi delegation stormed out of a league meeting in protest over a speech by Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari hailing Hezbollah and Shiite militias as "resistant movements."The decision by the Arab League is a significant blow to Hezbollah and it is also likely to further aggravate tensions in Lebanon, undermining the country's delicate political balance amid fierce political infighting between groups loyal to Hezbollah and Saudi-backed factions.CAIRO (AP) — The Arab League on Friday formally branded Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization, a move that raises concerns of deepening divisions among Arab countries and ramps up the pressure on the Shiite group, which is fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.The move aligns the 22-member league firmly behind Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, which made the same formal branding against Hezbollah on March 2.Earlier in the day, the Saudi delegation stormed out of a league meeting in protest over a speech by Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari hailing Hezbollah and Shiite militias as "resistant movements."The decision by the Arab League is a significant blow to Hezbollah and it is also likely to further aggravate tensions in Lebanon, undermining the country's delicate political balance amid fierce political infighting between groups loyal to Hezbollah and Saudi-backed factions.The league's decision also reflects deep regional divisions between Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shiite powerhouse Iran, Hezbollah's patron.The EU still allows Hezbollah’s “political wing” to operate in Europe

Amid renewed tensions between Iran and the Sunni Arab States, the six member Gulf Cooperation Council has declared Iranian-backed Hezbollah a terrorist organisation.Since 1980s, Iran has been exercising control over Lebanon through its proxy Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist military outfit.Jerusalem Post reports:

The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council named Hezbollah a terrorist organization on Wednesday, opening up the possibility of further sanctions against the Iran-allied group that wields influence in Lebanon and fights in Syria.“Until now, the Saudis had only designated individual operatives and Hezbollah’s Saudi branch as a terrorist organization, not its Lebanese core,” David Andrew Weinberg, a specialist on Gulf affairs and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Jerusalem Post.So far, the EU has only outlawed the terrorist group’s “military wing,” allowing Hezbollah to operate inside Europe with impunity.The decision comes against the backdrop of the recent crisis between Saudi Arabia and Lebanon in which Saudi Arabia has decided to stop

the transfer of security assistance to the Lebanese army and Lebanese security forces following the increasing influence of Hezbollah in state institutions.Such declarations regarding Hezbollah have been made in the past, but the decision now to define Hezbollah as a terrorist organization is designed to give the Gulf states more leeway against Hezbollah, as now they will be able to act more aggressively against it since given it is officially defined as a terrorist organization.Saudi Arabia periodically imposes sanctions on companies and individuals associated with Hezbollah, and it is likely that after this decision this activity will increase.Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah Tuesday called on his supporters to not be dragged into violence as those who would profit would be Israel and Saudi Arabia.In a speech on TV Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia of stepping to a low level with the broadcast on Saudi TV last week of a parody of himself, and teased the Saudis currently at war in Yemen saying that "Yemenis are the most deprived people in the world - more than the Palestinians'.A disabled San Francisco man bumped up against the war on terror after his bank put a hold on an online payment  to his dogwalker thinking his dog was a terrorist group.Bruce Francis, who has a form of multiple sclerosis, told KTVU that he was trying to pay his dogwalker online using Chase Bank only to have the bank put a hold on the funds.According to Francis he put the dog’s name in the memo line, setting off bells at the bank, which then alerted the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Notified by his dogwalker that said she had not received payment, Francis checked with his bank which referred him to OFAC for an explanation.“The Treasury Department official said ‘Yes, your instinct is right, your dogs name is similar to that of a terrorist organization,'” Francis recalled.to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist entity cleared the House Judiciary Committee today.Not more than 60 days after enactment of the bill, the State Department would have to submit a report to Congress on whether the Muslims Brotherhood meets the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization -- and if not, explain why not.The chairman stressed that under the designation "this administration would actually have to deny admittance to aliens tied to the Muslim Brotherhood rather than continue to proclaim to the world that the Brotherhood is a moderate and secular organization.""The United States must recognize and sanction the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization as part of our national security strategy.""We are deeply troubled by the politically motivated sentences that have been handed down against former President Morsi and several others," White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters last June after the deposed Muslim Brotherhood leader was sentenced to life in prison.Boko Haram is as if not more deadly than ISIS.This is reflected in policy as well, with far more political attention paid to ISIS than Boko Haram.While the mainstream media response about this tragedy has been underwhelming, the added calamity lies in how the Obama administration has seemingly neglected to treat Boko Haram and the victims of their maniacal violence with the same resources and attention that has been provided to ISIS and victims throughout Europe.-Boko Haram burns kids alive in Nigeria-

Yet the continual slaughter of innocent Africans has not elicited an equal response from the nation or from the Obama Administration, when in fact Boko Haram is the most deadly Islamic terror group on Earth.In 2014, Boko Haram killed 6,664 people, while ISIS was responsible for 6,073 deaths.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks that rattled Brussels on Tuesday.Last Friday, Belgian authorities arrested Salah Adeslam, one of the primary suspects in the November Paris terrorist attacks, who was hiding in the Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels.French President Francois Hollande remarked, “Through the Brussels attacks, it is the whole of Europe that is hit.”[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Paris Attacks]

Adam Nossiter of The New York Times finds that the Brussels attacks do not point just to security concerns within Belgium but more broadly reveal the “enduring vulnerability of Europe to terrorism.”Regarding the impact of the Brussels attacks on American politics, Ben Geier at Fortune thinks that the discourse of the 2016 presidential election will now move away from domestic and economic issues, benefitting Republican candidates.In late February, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation along party lines calling on the State Department to designate the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt a foreign terrorist organization."The Brotherhood is not, factually speaking, a terrorist group," said Shadi Hamid, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of "Islamic Exceptionalism: How the Struggle over Islam is Reshaping the Modern World."Gen. Sisi, along with U.S. allies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and imprisoned thousands of its members.As a result, the Islamic State group considers members of the Muslim Brotherhood to be apostates.The impact of the U.S. labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group goes beyond mere partisan politics.• EU and Turkey agree on deal • Watered down plans include request for UN help • Second day of summit includes Ahmet Davutoglu • Davutoglu: It's a humanitarian rather than bargaining issue • Erdogan: Europe needs to look at own record on migrants • Where did it all go wrong for Turkey?Last week EU and Turkish leaders met at a European Council summit to discuss a plan to solve the migrant crisis as thousands of refugees continue to make their way from Turkey to Greece.The proposals were thought up by Mrs Merkel and Mr Davutoglu the night before unbeknownst to European Council president Donald Tusk and other EU leaders and presented on the day as new demands from Ankara.The EU and Ankara have agreed on the outlines of a deal on Friday to stop migrants coming to Europe via Turkey by returning all those in Greece to Turkey from Sunday.Tense talks began on Thursday between EU leaders at the European Council summit as the Belgian prime minister expressed concerns that Ankara is blackmailing Europe.SACRAMENTO (CBS) — An Iraqi-born Sacramento man who allegedly lied to federal investigators about traveling to Syria between 2013 and 2104 has been charged with providing support to terrorists.A complaint filed on January 6, 2016 against Al-Jayab, described as a Palestinian born in Iraq who came to the United States as an Iraqi refugee in October 2012, alleges that “the defendant traveled to Syria to take up arms with terrorist organizations and concealed that conduct from immigration authorities.”The complaint also alleges that he communicated on social media with others about his intent to return to Syria to fight for terrorist organizations.Read Also: Sacramento Man Pleads Not Guilty To Lying About Syria Trip

Analysis of IP addresses and other information established that Al-Jayab accessed the Internet via a satellite that covered both eastern Turkey and areas of northern Syria during his travels abroad over the winter of 2013-2014, according to the complaint.Al-Jayab allegedly lied about traveling to Syria to fight against the Syrian government, according to the complaint.Lebanon-based Hezbollah is paying an increasingly high price for its loyalty to Iran; on Friday, the Arab League joined other world leaders in a formal vote declaring the Iranian proxy a terrorist entity.“We decided to label Hezbollah a terrorist group in accordance with a project submitted by the United Arab Emirates regarding Iranian interference in the Arab region,” Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Ahmad Bin Hali said in a statement.The tiny island kingdom of Bahrain, a member of the GCC and the Arab League, was the first Arab nation to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist entity in March 2013.Hezbollah is listed as a terrorist organization in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel.Shortly after the GCC’s decision to label the Lebanese organization a terrorist group, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah slammed the Gulf Arab countries’ decision.On Friday, March 11, 2016, Egypt’s state news agency says the Arab League has formally branded Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization.(AP Photo Ahmed Omar, File)

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations formally branded Hezbollah a terrorist organization on Wednesday, ramping up the pressure on the Lebanese militant group fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.Saudi Arabia in 2014 designated a Saudi affiliate of Hezbollah a terrorist group along with the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Yemen's Shiite Houthis and other groups.The GCC announcement came a few hours after a televised speech by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in which he harshly criticized Saudi Arabia for punitive measures that targeted Lebanon recently, including the halt in aid and Gulf travel warnings."Who gives Saudi Arabia the right to punish Lebanon and its army and Lebanese people living in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf just because Hezbollah is speaking out?This is a Techmeme archive page.It shows how the site appeared at 1:05 AM ET, March 7, 2016.The most current version of the site as always is available at our home page.Libertarian Congressman Justin Amash has endorsed Ted Cruz, calling him a "principled defender of the Constitution."But Cruz has arguably proposed the most unconstitutional piece of legislation ever that, under the guise of preventing 12 ISIS fighters from returning to the country, will assualt the citizenship rights of all Americans.In fact, the bill, called the Expatriate Terrorist Act, will "expatriate" terrorists less and ordinary Americans more.That's why Sen.

CAIRO (AP) — The Arab League on Friday formally branded Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization, a move that raises concerns of deepening divisions among Arab countries and ramps up the pressure on the Shiite group, which is fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.The move aligns the 22-member league firmly behind Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, which made the same formal branding against Hezbollah on March 2.Earlier in the day, the Saudi delegation stormed out of a league meeting in protest over a speech by Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari hailing Hezbollah and Shiite militias as "resistant movements."The decision by the Arab League is a significant blow to Hezbollah and it is also likely to further aggravate tensions in Lebanon, undermining the country's delicate political balance amid fierce political infighting between groups loyal to Hezbollah and Saudi-backed factions.CAIRO (AP) — The Arab League on Friday formally branded Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group a terrorist organization, a move that raises concerns of deepening divisions among Arab countries and ramps up the pressure on the Shiite group, which is fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.The move aligns the 22-member league firmly behind Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, which made the same formal branding against Hezbollah on March 2.Earlier in the day, the Saudi delegation stormed out of a league meeting in protest over a speech by Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari hailing Hezbollah and Shiite militias as "resistant movements."The decision by the Arab League is a significant blow to Hezbollah and it is also likely to further aggravate tensions in Lebanon, undermining the country's delicate political balance amid fierce political infighting between groups loyal to Hezbollah and Saudi-backed factions.The league's decision also reflects deep regional divisions between Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shiite powerhouse Iran, Hezbollah's patron.The EU still allows Hezbollah’s “political wing” to operate in Europe

Amid renewed tensions between Iran and the Sunni Arab States, the six member Gulf Cooperation Council has declared Iranian-backed Hezbollah a terrorist organisation.Since 1980s, Iran has been exercising control over Lebanon through its proxy Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist military outfit.Jerusalem Post reports:

The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council named Hezbollah a terrorist organization on Wednesday, opening up the possibility of further sanctions against the Iran-allied group that wields influence in Lebanon and fights in Syria.“Until now, the Saudis had only designated individual operatives and Hezbollah’s Saudi branch as a terrorist organization, not its Lebanese core,” David Andrew Weinberg, a specialist on Gulf affairs and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Jerusalem Post.So far, the EU has only outlawed the terrorist group’s “military wing,” allowing Hezbollah to operate inside Europe with impunity.The decision comes against the backdrop of the recent crisis between Saudi Arabia and Lebanon in which Saudi Arabia has decided to stop

the transfer of security assistance to the Lebanese army and Lebanese security forces following the increasing influence of Hezbollah in state institutions.Such declarations regarding Hezbollah have been made in the past, but the decision now to define Hezbollah as a terrorist organization is designed to give the Gulf states more leeway against Hezbollah, as now they will be able to act more aggressively against it since given it is officially defined as a terrorist organization.Saudi Arabia periodically imposes sanctions on companies and individuals associated with Hezbollah, and it is likely that after this decision this activity will increase.Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah Tuesday called on his supporters to not be dragged into violence as those who would profit would be Israel and Saudi Arabia.In a speech on TV Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia of stepping to a low level with the broadcast on Saudi TV last week of a parody of himself, and teased the Saudis currently at war in Yemen saying that "Yemenis are the most deprived people in the world - more than the Palestinians'.A disabled San Francisco man bumped up against the war on terror after his bank put a hold on an online payment  to his dogwalker thinking his dog was a terrorist group.Bruce Francis, who has a form of multiple sclerosis, told KTVU that he was trying to pay his dogwalker online using Chase Bank only to have the bank put a hold on the funds.According to Francis he put the dog’s name in the memo line, setting off bells at the bank, which then alerted the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Notified by his dogwalker that said she had not received payment, Francis checked with his bank which referred him to OFAC for an explanation.“The Treasury Department official said ‘Yes, your instinct is right, your dogs name is similar to that of a terrorist organization,'” Francis recalled.to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist entity cleared the House Judiciary Committee today.Not more than 60 days after enactment of the bill, the State Department would have to submit a report to Congress on whether the Muslims Brotherhood meets the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization -- and if not, explain why not.The chairman stressed that under the designation "this administration would actually have to deny admittance to aliens tied to the Muslim Brotherhood rather than continue to proclaim to the world that the Brotherhood is a moderate and secular organization.""The United States must recognize and sanction the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization as part of our national security strategy.""We are deeply troubled by the politically motivated sentences that have been handed down against former President Morsi and several others," White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters last June after the deposed Muslim Brotherhood leader was sentenced to life in prison.Boko Haram is as if not more deadly than ISIS.This is reflected in policy as well, with far more political attention paid to ISIS than Boko Haram.While the mainstream media response about this tragedy has been underwhelming, the added calamity lies in how the Obama administration has seemingly neglected to treat Boko Haram and the victims of their maniacal violence with the same resources and attention that has been provided to ISIS and victims throughout Europe.-Boko Haram burns kids alive in Nigeria-

Yet the continual slaughter of innocent Africans has not elicited an equal response from the nation or from the Obama Administration, when in fact Boko Haram is the most deadly Islamic terror group on Earth.In 2014, Boko Haram killed 6,664 people, while ISIS was responsible for 6,073 deaths.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks that rattled Brussels on Tuesday.Last Friday, Belgian authorities arrested Salah Adeslam, one of the primary suspects in the November Paris terrorist attacks, who was hiding in the Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels.French President Francois Hollande remarked, “Through the Brussels attacks, it is the whole of Europe that is hit.”[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Paris Attacks]

Adam Nossiter of The New York Times finds that the Brussels attacks do not point just to security concerns within Belgium but more broadly reveal the “enduring vulnerability of Europe to terrorism.”Regarding the impact of the Brussels attacks on American politics, Ben Geier at Fortune thinks that the discourse of the 2016 presidential election will now move away from domestic and economic issues, benefitting Republican candidates.In late February, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation along party lines calling on the State Department to designate the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt a foreign terrorist organization."The Brotherhood is not, factually speaking, a terrorist group," said Shadi Hamid, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of "Islamic Exceptionalism: How the Struggle over Islam is Reshaping the Modern World."Gen. Sisi, along with U.S. allies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and imprisoned thousands of its members.As a result, the Islamic State group considers members of the Muslim Brotherhood to be apostates.The impact of the U.S. labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group goes beyond mere partisan politics.• EU and Turkey agree on deal • Watered down plans include request for UN help • Second day of summit includes Ahmet Davutoglu • Davutoglu: It's a humanitarian rather than bargaining issue • Erdogan: Europe needs to look at own record on migrants • Where did it all go wrong for Turkey?Last week EU and Turkish leaders met at a European Council summit to discuss a plan to solve the migrant crisis as thousands of refugees continue to make their way from Turkey to Greece.The proposals were thought up by Mrs Merkel and Mr Davutoglu the night before unbeknownst to European Council president Donald Tusk and other EU leaders and presented on the day as new demands from Ankara.The EU and Ankara have agreed on the outlines of a deal on Friday to stop migrants coming to Europe via Turkey by returning all those in Greece to Turkey from Sunday.Tense talks began on Thursday between EU leaders at the European Council summit as the Belgian prime minister expressed concerns that Ankara is blackmailing Europe.SACRAMENTO (CBS) — An Iraqi-born Sacramento man who allegedly lied to federal investigators about traveling to Syria between 2013 and 2104 has been charged with providing support to terrorists.A complaint filed on January 6, 2016 against Al-Jayab, described as a Palestinian born in Iraq who came to the United States as an Iraqi refugee in October 2012, alleges that “the defendant traveled to Syria to take up arms with terrorist organizations and concealed that conduct from immigration authorities.”The complaint also alleges that he communicated on social media with others about his intent to return to Syria to fight for terrorist organizations.Read Also: Sacramento Man Pleads Not Guilty To Lying About Syria Trip

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Saudi-led bloc of six Gulf Arab nations formally branded Hezbollah a terrorist organization on Wednesday, ramping up the pressure on the Lebanese militant group fighting on the side of President Bashar Assad in Syria.Saudi Arabia in 2014 designated a Saudi affiliate of Hezbollah a terrorist group along with the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Yemen's Shiite Houthis and other groups.The GCC announcement came a few hours after a televised speech by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in which he harshly criticized Saudi Arabia for punitive measures that targeted Lebanon recently, including the halt in aid and Gulf travel warnings."Who gives Saudi Arabia the right to punish Lebanon and its army and Lebanese people living in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf just because Hezbollah is speaking out?This is a Techmeme archive page.It shows how the site appeared at 1:05 AM ET, March 7, 2016.The most current version of the site as always is available at our home page.Libertarian Congressman Justin Amash has endorsed Ted Cruz, calling him a "principled defender of the Constitution."But Cruz has arguably proposed the most unconstitutional piece of legislation ever that, under the guise of preventing 12 ISIS fighters from returning to the country, will assualt the citizenship rights of all Americans.In fact, the bill, called the Expatriate Terrorist Act, will "expatriate" terrorists less and ordinary Americans more.That's why Sen. Rand Paul, who had himself previously called for revoking the passports of Americans who join ISIS, is opposing the Cruz bill.If the government has evidence that these folks [returning terrorists] are indeed terrorists, then why should it merely strip them of their citizenship and stop them from returning home (or leaving if they are already here)?Twitter says it has suspended over 125,000 Twitter accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist acts.Twitter says these terrorist acts are primarily connected to ISIS.Twitter also says in its post that it has increased the size of teams that review reports about threats of violence and terrorism.ISIS currently has other problems in addition to the sudden loss of over 100,000 Twitter accounts.is reporting that the terrorist organization is slashing the salaries of its fighters by 50%.FBI Director James Comey praised Twitter in July 2015 for helping block terrorist content.(bit.ly/1KvrmZ5)

Twitter's announcement comes as many tech companies – led by Facebook – have taken stronger steps to police controversial content online in the face of threats from legislators to force the companies to report "terrorist activity" on their sites to law enforcement.The announcement was also notable because Twitter has said little about its efforts to combat Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and similar groups even though it has been criticized for not doing enough.Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's program on extremism, said Friday's report showcased an "impressive number" of takedowns, but said that Twitter still appears to police extremist content in a mostly "episodic" way.In January, a delegation of top national security officials met tech industry leaders from Twitter, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), but most companies, including Twitter, did not send their chief executive officers.Still, Twitter said in a blog post that it has cooperated with law enforcement when appropriate.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic More

In a preliminary report released on Monday, Egyptian investigators say they have found no evidence that a Russian passenger plane flying over the Sinai was downed by terrorist or criminal action.The preliminary report released today says there is no evidence of a bomb and that the team would continue to investigate."A bomb on a plane of mostly Russian tourists traveling from a beach destination would be detrimental to the already struggling tourism industry.Since the plane crash tourism has already dropped off sharply in Sharm el Sheikh."In November, the Russian government said it had "unequivocally" determined the plane was downed by terrorists, because it had found "traces of foreign explosives" in the wreckage.Conservative outlets quickly hatched a conspiracy theory that the White House "censored" French President Francois Hollande from using the phrase "Islamist terrorism" during a bilateral meeting with President Obama in Washington, D.C.The Media Research Center claimed on April 1, "the audio of Hollande's translator goes silent, beginning with the words 'Islamist terrorism'" and that "even the audio of Hollande saying the words 'Islamist terrorism' in French have, apparently, been edited from the video":

The White House website has censored a video of French Pres. Francois Hollande saying that "Islamist terrorism" is at the "roots of terrorism."The White House briefly pulled video of a press event on terrorism with Pres. Obama, and when it reappeared on the WhiteHouse.gov website and YouTube, the audio of Hollande's translator goes silent, beginning with the words "Islamist terrorism," then begins again at the end of his sentence.The Federalist reported on April 1, that "the audio of the French-to-English interpreter stops right before Hollande characterizes 'Islamist terrorism' as the root of terrorism in Syria and Iraq":

President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande met in Washington on Thursday to discuss ways for the two countries to work together to defeat terrorism.Townhall reported on April 1, that "the White House scrubbed the words "Islamic extremists" from remarks made by Hollande," and that this demonstrated that "President Obama and his White House do not" get that "you cannot beat an enemy that you are unwilling to name":

The Daily Caller: "White House Censors French President For Using The Words 'Islamist Terrorism.'"The Obama administration censored a video released on Friday of French President Francois Hollande saying that "Islamic terrorism" was at the "root of terrorism."Hollande made the comment Thursday at a press event at the White House featuring President Barack Obama and members of his national security team.The White House briefly pulled video of the press event, MRC TV reports, but when it reappeared on WhiteHouse.gov and YouTube, the audio of Hollande's translator goes silent — starting with the words "Islamic terrorism" and resuming with "and we note … ."The official transcript of the remarks posted on WhiteHouse.gov shows that Hollande's translator would speak these words at that point in the video: " …  Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.…"

The White House provided this explanation for the gap under the YouTube video:

So here where the free speech is protected by the Constitution our "leader" censors our oldest ally?(CNSNews.com) – Author Salman Rushdie--against whom Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a death fatwa in 1989 because of his book "The Satanic Verses"--says that it is a miskake for President Barack Obama not to use the term "Islamic terrorism."“It’s a mistake that the president is making to not use the term Islamic terrorism,” Rushdie said Wednesday during a question-and-answer session hosted by New York University’s Washington, D.C. Academic Center.Rushdie was responding to a question from an audience member on whether he had changed his views since he had written a 2001 New York Times opinion piece entitled Yes, This Is About Islam.“Terrorism in the Muslim world impacts Muslims first and most viciously, and most Muslims are as hostile to it as most non-Muslims are,” Rushdie went on to say.Rushdie said he understood the rationale behind trying to avoid using the term Islamic terrorism “for virtuous reasons of not wishing to stigmatize a large number of innocent people with the deeds of the few.”Although Trump hasn’t killed anyone to our knowledge and can’t be compared to Daesh in most ways, his political strategy actually mirrors that of the phony caliphate in some ways.Where there is calm, find spaces for the creation of chaos (e.g. unsuspecting cities like Paris and Brussels)

3.Syrian Kurdish troops allied with Arab fighters have taken vast territory from Daesh in al-Raqqa and left its capital exposed.In the case of Brussels, municipal policies that gave a sense of pride and dignity to inhabitants of the poorer quarters of the city, and economic policies of attracting factory and other jobs into those areas, would be important manifestations of that kind of public policy love.US politicians such as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz who are trying to get ahead by polarizing American society and fearmongering just cannot resist jumping on the Daesh train and joining in with the attack on the gray zone.Bill Maher confronted Senator Cory Booker on his use of the phrase “violent extremism” instead of “Islamic extremism,” telling him that could seriously impact his party in the fall.Booker acknowledged that it’s a serious threat, but pointed to Christian terrorists.Maher retorted, “Christians are not trying to get a dirty bomb.”When Booker brought up how people don’t like fearmongering, Maher told him that fear is important to people and “it’s not mongering if there’s an attack.”Maher implored him, “Just say Islamic terrorism.Given that terrorists acting in the name of Islamic State have wrong-footed European intelligence and security services so spectacularly – the Belgians, this week and the French twice last year – it should be assumed there will be more such attacks in Europe.Kurdish forces in the north of Syria and in the west of Iraq are taking back territory held by IS;

“A technical issue with the audio during the recording of President Hollande’s remarks led to a brief drop in the audio recording of the English interpretation.According to MRC TV, as of Saturday, the White House has removed its comments and link to the “complete audio” video and replaced the muted video with the version containing the “complete audio” on the White House Video page.French President Francois Hollande’s comments this week in Washington about Islamic terrorism -- a term President Obama won’t use -- were omitted from an official White House video.However, an audio gap occurs in the original White House video where the French-to-English translator would have said: “Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.Republicans and others have been highly critical of Obama, and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, for not saying the words “Islamic terrorism” when talking about the Islamic State terror group, which has claimed responsibility for the recent, deadly bombing attacks in Paris and Brussels.“After every one of these attacks, the president does a national TV conference where he refuses to say the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism.’The White House told several news outlets on Friday the audio gap was the result of a "technical issue" not an attempt to scrub or censor Hollande’s comments and that an updated video with the complete audio was posted on WhiteHouse.gov soon after the problem was recognized.President Obama is so paranoid about linking terrorists to the Muslim faith that when French President François Hollande used the phrase “Islamist terrorism” at a meeting in Washington, White House officials posted their official press video with audio of the words cut out completely.The 8-minute clip was posted on the White House Web site and showed Hollande discussing the global terror threat at a Nuclear Security Summit meeting with Obama and advisers Thursday.The White House’s transcript of the event shows the French leader declared at the 4:49 minute mark that “the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.”A White House official said the audio gap was the result of a technical error that happened to come as Hollande was uttering the controversial words.As of 6 p.m. Friday, the White House had posted footage with the words “Islamic terrorism” included.The White House website has censored a video of French Pres. Francois Hollande saying that “Islamist terrorism” is at the “roots of terrorism.”The White House briefly pulled video of a press event on terrorism with Pres. Obama, and when it reappeared on the WhiteHouse.gov website and YouTube, the audio of Hollande’s translator goes silent, beginning with the words “Islamist terrorism,” then begins again at the end of his sentence.Even the audio of Hollande saying the words “Islamist terrorism” in French have, apparently, been edited from the video.According to the official White House transcript of Hollande’s remarks, Hollande refers to “Islamist terrorism.”“But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, [Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.But in the White House video, the translated portion of his remarks about Islamist terrorism is muted, starting at 4:48 in this video, according to a report posted by the Media Research Center.Watch the official White House video below:

In the White House video, starting at 4:48, Hollande’s female translator goes silent, while he continues speaking for about 15 seconds before the translation restarts.Hollande’s reference to Islamist terror also appears to have been muted in the White House video.The White House’s edited version of the video also has Hollande saying the following: “But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism–and we note that Daesh is losing ground thanks to the strikes we’ve been able to launch with the coalition.”The official video of the remarks posted by the Nuclear Security Summit was not edited, and includes the translation of Hollande’s remarks referring to “Islamist” terror.On Thursday, Hollande told Barack Obama, “We are also making sure that between Europe and the United States there can be a very high level coordination.We’re actually censoring a world leader who’s precisely and accurately describing a problem, because it might offend some people.And if he decided to put out a statement distancing himself from Hollande on this, that would also be okay.Or if Hollande started dropping F-bombs or something, sure, fine, okay.Good lord, our government has lost its way so completely that I’m being forced to defend the President of France.But has the White House taken the terrorism white washing a step further?MRCTV reported that a video posted by the White House appears to edit out “Islamist Terrorism” from a recent speech given by French President Francois Hollande.While the words are in the speech transcript, they’ve been noticeably scrubbed from the video.According to the official White House transcript of Hollande’s remarks, Hollande refers to “Islamist terrorism.”“But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, [Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.The White House translation of remarks made by French President François Hollande Thursday appeared to cut out just when Hollande began to use the term “Islamist terrorism.”“But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism…” the translation begins, before it abruptly stops.The translation picks up again a few seconds later when Hollander says,”We note that Daesh is losing ground thanks to the strikes we’ve been able to launch with the coalition.”Judging by the White House transcript, the translation cut out just before Hollande used a term President Barack Obama has avoided using:

But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.The video released by the White House is only missing that segment of the translation, and the rest of 500-word speech was translated without incident.The White House censored the video of French President Francois Hollande daring to argue that “Islamist terrorism” is at the “roots of terrorism.”According to MRCTV, the White House pulled the original, unedited version from  WhiteHouse.gov and YouTube and then reuploaded the video with the words “Islamist terrorism” silenced.Moreover, the official transcript on WhiteHouse.gov at one point did not include Hollande’s claim that  “Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.In recent months,Republican presidential candidates have criticized Obama for not using the words “radical islamic terrorism.”The audio on the clip perfectly tracks the transcript — except when it cuts out for exactly two sentences and then resumes:

But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq.They’ve actually reached the point now where they’re blacking out references to Islam for English speakers in official state video of talks over terrorism.Hollande didn’t say “Islamic terrorism,” which is the supposedly objectionable term.“Islamic” describes all things Muslim; “Islamist” describes a supremacist view in which Islam is the highest authority of the state.Point being, Hollande chose his words carefully here according to the White House transcript so as not to conflate the average Muslim with the jihadis he’s discussing — and the White House still censored him.Facebook, Google and Twitter are stepping up efforts to combat online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants, but the Internet companies are doing it quietly to avoid the perception that they are helping the authorities police the Web.Just a day earlier, the French prime minister and European Commission officials met separately with Facebook, Google, Twitter Inc and other companies to demand faster action on what the commission called "online terrorism incitement and hate speech."The Internet companies described their policies as straightforward: they ban certain types of content in accordance with their own terms of service, and require court orders to remove or block anything beyond that."If they knew what magic sauce went into pushing content into the newsfeed, spammers or whomever would take advantage of that," said a security expert who had worked at both Facebook and Twitter, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.One of the most significant yet least understood aspects of the propaganda issue is the range of ways in which social media companies deal with government officials.Nicole Wong, who previously served as the White House's deputy chief technology officer, said tech companies would be reluctant to create a database of jihadists videos, even if it could be kept current enough to be relevant, for fear that repressive governments would demand such set-ups to pre-screen any content they do not like.In a rare prime-time address to the country from the Oval Office, President Obama made clear that he thinks increased gun control at home is essential to fighting ISIS—and terrorism in general.In the 13-minute address, Obama laid out the reasons why he believes the “terrorist threat has evolved into a new phase” in which “terrorists turn to mass violence.”Part of that defense must involve lawmakers and Obama called on Congress to take several steps:

Obama was also adamant that there are a few things the country should not do:

Obama was particularly forceful on speaking up against Islamophobia.As part of an impassioned plea against discrimination, Obama criticized those who have suggested those from certain religions should get priority to be accepted as refugees:

Ultimately though, the address failed to outline any significant shift in strategy in how the United States should go about its fight against terrorism, besides for a call to tighten the country’s visa waiver program to more carefully check whether those entering the country had been in a war zone.Obama made it clear he thinks the current path should continue, noting that it consists of four basic steps:

The use of a prime-time address has been widely interpreted as a sign that the White House is worried “the American people, distracted by the overheated cacophony of the campaign season, are not listening to him,” as the Washington Post’s Greg Jaffe wrote.Making an intervention at the East Asia Summit in the Malaysian capital, Modi said terrorism is “no longer a peripheral problem” for the region and the recent assaults in Paris and Ankara have demonstrated that terror groups had a worldwide reach, both for recruiting members and choosing targets.Modi reiterated his calls made at the recent G20 Summit in Turkey and the ASEAN-India Summit in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday for coordinated action against international terrorism while delinking it from religion.UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon with international leaders at the East Asia Summit (EAS) meeting in Kuala  country should use or support terrorism.Five elements for an Asian Century: PM @narendramodi defines his vision for the East Asia Summit pic.twitter.com/l3mHs1Fl2L— Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) November 22, 2015

ANTALYA, Turkey, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official on Saturday called for a successful summit of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders in Antalya, Turkey to help eliminate the soil that breeds ground for terrorism.Zhu Guangyao, China's vice finance minister, said the terror attacks hitting Paris on Friday evening is showing the world once again that terrorism is "the common enemy of all mankind."As the primary platform for global economic coordination and cooperation, G20 leaders are scheduled to focus on means to achieve an inclusive, strong and balanced growth for the world economy and cope with the migration crisis and the scourge of terrorism.SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is ready to join France and the international community in stepping up security cooperation and combating terrorism, President Xi Jinping told French President Francois Hollande on Saturday, after attacks in Paris that killed about 120 people.In a telephone call to Hollande, Xi also condemned Friday's attacks, offering condolences to the victims and their families, according to comments published on the Chinese foreign ministry website.Gunmen and bombers attacked restaurants, a concert hall and a sports stadium in the French capital in what Hollande has called an unprecedented terrorist attack.Fresh from emergency phone talks with the head of ASIO, Duncan Lewis, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin, and the National Security Coordinator, Greg Moriarty, Mr Turnbull said the terror alert level would remain on "High", but counselled Australians to be confident that their police and security services would protect them.In his strongest comments since Friday night's coordinated attacks in Paris, Mr Turnbull left open the prospect of a greater Australian commitment in the war against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.Asked if he agreed with the comments of French President Francois Hollande that his country and the West were at war with terrorism, Mr Turnbull was frank.However, Mr Turnbull, who is in Turkey for the world's premier international leadership forum, the G20, said he was hopeful that a political solution would eventually be struck because it was the only way to stabilise Syria.That is a major advance in itself as the Syrian conflict, as Mr Turnbull noted from the resort town of Antalya where the G20 is being staged, has become a "proxy" war of sorts with the Russians backing Assad, despite his record as a murderous dictator and war criminal, and the Americans backing Syrian rebel forces including the Free Syrian Army.Stengel is an accomplished journalist, editor and author who left TIME magazine, where he was managing editor (the top editorial job), to join the Obama administration as Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.As explained by Jim Glassman, a journalist who held the position during the latter portion of the George W. Bush presidency, the job title does have "public affairs" in it, meaning you oversee the department's army of spokespersons worldwide, but the primary duties involve public diplomacy.Stengel is, for obvious reasons, also concentrating on this subject, especially via his role with the Office of Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (OSCC), a successor to an operation Glassman set up, the Global Strategic Engagement Center.One thing people don't realize is that if you look at the amount of content out there that is counter-ISIL, it is exponentially greater than it was a year ago — in part because people around the world have expressed revulsion at what they do.It involves 100 journalists from more than 80 countries who come to the U.S for a few weeks to study the way we do things.To our readers: The future of the Supreme Court.The most far-right presidential candidates in decades.Never has the work of Right Wing Watch, a project of the People For the American Way dedicated to exposing the Far-Right's extreme and intolerant agenda, been more important.And, as a non-profit, our main source of support is readers like you.If you use Right Wing Watch, please consider making a contribution to support our work at this critical time.I welcomed more than 50 leaders from around the world to make sure we’re working together to meet one of the greatest threats to global security—terrorists getting their hands on a weapon of mass destruction, like a nuclear weapon.Fortunately, because of our efforts so far, no terrorist group has yet succeeded in obtaining a nuclear device or producing a dirty bomb using radioactive materials.Working with other nations, we have removed or secured enough nuclear material for more than 150 nuclear weapons—material that will now never fall into the hands of terrorists.That means that as terrorists and criminal gangs look around for the deadly ingredients for a nuclear device, vast regions of the world are now off limits.That’s why I invited all the nations represented at this summit to join us in a broader discussion among our intelligence and security services on how we can improve information sharing to prevent terrorist attacks.Here’s The Cost Of Global Terrorism by Frank Holmes

We were saddened this week to hear that at least 30 people were killed and many dozens more injured in ISIS-related suicide bombings that targeted an airport and train station in Brussels.The Belgian and European Union capital joins Paris, San Bernardino, Ankara, Jakarta and too many other cities in the past year alone that have come under fire from the Islamic terrorist group.The attacks also highlight the importance of owning gold, which investors have traditionally valued for its stability in times of crisis and currency fluctuations.I recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in gold stocks, the other 5 percent in physical bars, coins and jewelry—in both good times and bad.Grove, who passed away this week at the age of 79, grew up behind the Iron Curtain in a country that, at the time, knew nothing of individual rights or personal and intellectual property.Global financial markets reacted to the deadly terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday with predictable swiftness."It is all to do with the events in Brussels ... but the reaction is muted, which also shows that after all the terrorist attacks we have seen, markets have learned to live with these kind of things," Rabobank euro zone economist Emile Cardon told Reuters.“The impact of terror attacks on the market has always faded over time,” Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management, told the Wall Street Journal.The muted response on global markets, however, doesn’t mean the Brussels attacks won’t have an economic or political impact.“There is a growing perception among European public opinion that EU leaders are not in control of the continent’s terrorist threat, given this attack comes on the heels of events in Paris last year," analysts from the political consultancy firm Eurasia Group said.As developed countries embrace a slew of tobacco control measures such as higher taxes, raising the smoking age and plain packaging of cigarettes, the opportunities to profit from smuggling have exploded.In some cases, especially war zones, cigarette smuggling is organised by terrorist or jihadist organisations under the guise of humanitarian aid (ex-Yugoslavia),” CAT state in its report on Financing Terrorism.According to CAT, cigarette smuggling and trafficking represents more than 20 percent of terrorist financing of the groups identified.According to a Department of State report published in December, 2015, operation Black Poseidon, which targeted the illegal tobacco trade in Eastern Europe, led to the discovery of a covert cigarette factory in Sumy, Ukraine which was concealed in an underground complex.New York is reaping the whirlwind of sky-high cigarette taxes with a wave of smuggling decimating the state’s revenue.The potential international economic risks associated with GOP front-runner Donald Trump winning the White House in November are equivalent to those posed by the threat of jihadi terrorism, according to a new analysis from The Economist Intelligence Unit The EIU, which periodically updates its list of the 10 greatest individual threats to international economic conditions in the foreseeable future, considers a further slowdown in the already cooling Chinese economy to be the most significant cloud currently hanging over the global marketplace."Indeed, 2016 ended up being Wall Street's worst start to a calendar year on record, and the recent adoption of lower – in some cases, negative – interest rates around the world speaks to just how far government officials are willing to go to stimulate what has recently proved to be elusive economic growth.The EIU's risk assessments don't typically venture into the political spectrum by focusing on an individual candidate's proposals."In the event of a Trump victory, his hostile attitude to free trade, and alienation of Mexico and China in particular, could escalate rapidly into a trade war," the analysis says."Although we do not expect Mr. Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton , there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil or a sudden economic downturn."A hypothetical President Trump, however, is hardly the greatest threat currently facing international markets, according to the EIU.Alex Pfeiffer at the Daily Caller reports that the British "news" magazine The Economist fancies itself as a "global forecasting service," and in its "service," it has decided that "Donald Trump wins the presidential election" is on the same threat level as "The rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilises the global economy."Trump’s hostility to free trade and his interest in “trade war” apparently present a serious threat, and his “exceptionally right-wing stance” on indiscriminately killing the family members of terrorists (that makes you “right-wing”?)would present a “potent recruitment tool” for jihadis:

Thus far Mr Trump has given very few details of his policies - and these tend to be prone to constant revision - but a few themes have become apparent.In the event of a Trump victory, his hostile attitude to free trade, and alienation of Mexico and China in particular, could escalate rapidly into a trade war -- and at the least scupper the Trans-Pacific Partnership between the US and 11 other American and Asian states signed in February 2016.The Economist forecasters also hedge that they except Trump to lose to Hillary, and that the “innate hostility” within the GOP establishment will impair his ability to pass much in the unlikely event that he won:

Although we do not expect Mr Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on US soil or a sudden economic downturn.The rising threat of jihadi terrorism, a military clash over China's expansionism in the South China Sea, and Donald Trump as president -- one of these things is not like the others, and it's not the one you'd expect.According to a report published by The Economist Intelligence Unit on Thursday, the prospect of conflict in the South China Sea poses a lesser risk to the world's economic stability than the other two threats.Yes -- that means the EIU, a research and analysis group associated with The Economist magazine, believes a Trump presidency would be just as risky as the threat of jihadi terrorism.The prospect of Trump winning the U.S. presidential election and the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilizing the global economy are both "high impact" threats that have a "moderate probability" of occurring, according to the EIU.Here's the full list of global threats from the EIU report:

Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant  has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.President Vladimir Putin has said Russia wants to fight terrorism jointly with the rest of the world, but added that he would not let Western leaders dictate the terms

Putin said that although he wants to join Western nations in the fight against terror, it did not mean that Russia 'should agree with everything that others decide on these matters.'In February last year, France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine agreed on a set of peace accords, known as the Minsk agreements, which have helped to stop the war between pro-Moscow separatists and government troops in southeast Ukraine.'Everyone says that the Minsk Agreements must be implemented and then the sanctions issue may be reconsidered,' Putin told Bild, referring to Western sanctions imposed on Russia.Putin drew attention to a clause in the peace agreement that required Ukraine to introduce constitutional reform by the end of last year, calling this 'the main, the key issue in the settlement process'.On the economic front, Putin acknowledged that the country's economy had been hard hit by the plunge in oil prices but also said that there was a positive side insofar as it would force Russia to improve the structure of its public finances.

'Aside from claims that climate change benefits ISIS and Boko Haram, both President Barack Obama (at COP21) and Bill Nye “The Science Guy” recently compared the dangers of climate change and global warming to the threat of terrorism.President of France François Hollande also made the comparison on Monday at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris.Shortly after visiting the site of the recent terrorist attacks at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris with French President François Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Obama gave the opening address at the 21st annual Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris to address the issues of global climate change.While the COP21 in Paris hosts the leaders of more than 150 countries while they discuss plans to combat climate change, the conference has a lot of people talking about global warming and what we can do to fight it.Back at the Paris climate change conference, French President Hollande did not shy away from a comparison of fighting terrorism and fighting climate change.Brussels Airport reopened to a thin stream of passengers on Sunday, 12 days after suicide bombers destroyed its departure hall and killed 16 people.Belgium's main airport had not handled passenger flights since two suspected Islamist militants carried out the suicide attacks.Many flights have been rerouted to Belgium's regional airports or other nearby hubs such as Amsterdam and Paris, with high-speed trains to and from Brussels packed.Brussels Airport has warned passengers to arrive three hours before their flights due to increased security and to come by car.With its temporary check-in zone, it will only be able to handle some 800 departing passengers or about five to six flights per hour, around 20 percent of previous capacity.BRUSSELS—Brussels Airport reopened for a small number of passenger flights Sunday, nearly two weeks after it was hit by deadly terrorist attacks.The airport had remained closed to regularly scheduled passenger flights since twin suicide bombings devastated the departure hall on March 22, killing at least 16 people and injuring scores more.An equal number died in the center of the Belgian capital in a bombing attack on a subway...Terrorists could carry out a Paris or Brussels-style attack in Britain using a mobile phone case that can encrypt iPhone calls and texts, a security expert has warned.The Vysk device clips to the phone and, with the flick of a switch, can be put into stealth mode to stop hackers from gaining access to its data.But Professor Anthony Glees, director of the University of Buckingham’s Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, said terrorists could make use of the features to evade the security services – and bring terror to Britain’s streets.‘If we are told by any intelligence services that they suspect the device is being used by a terrorist then we have the ability to turn it off remotely.’The device will be sold in Harrods and Selfridges for £825, which will include unlimited encrypted phone calls for a year.Brussels Airport reopened to a thin stream of passengers on Sunday, 12 days after suicide bombers destroyed its departure hall and killed 16 people.Belgium's main airport had not handled passenger flights since two suspected Islamist militants carried out the suicide attacks.Many flights have been rerouted to Belgium's regional airports or other nearby hubs such as Amsterdam and Paris, with high-speed trains to and from Brussels packed.Brussels Airport has warned passengers to arrive three hours before their flights due to increased security and to come by car.With its temporary check-in zone, it will only be able to handle some 800 departing passengers or about five to six flights per hour, around 20 percent of previous capacity.Brussels: Brussels Airport will partially reopen for passenger flights on Sunday, 12 days after suicide bombers destroyed its departure hall and killed 16 people.The country's main airport has not handled passenger flights since two suspected Islamist militants carried out the suicide attacks.There will be far fewer flights than normal when it reopens, and tighter security will be in place, but the airport operator said the aim was to return to full capacity by the summer.Feist said the airport had planned three flights for the first day, to Faro, Athens and Turin, all operated by Brussels Airlines.The airport says it aims to return to maximum capacity before the start of summer holidays at the end of June or early July, with some check-in desks restored in the departure hall, followed by a full reopening of that space.Brussels terrorist attack: Airport to reopen after bombings

    Brussels: Brussels Airport will partially reopen for passenger flights on Sunday, 12 days after suicide bombers destroyed its departure hall and killed 16 people.The country's main airport has not handled passenger flights since two suspected Islamist militants carried out the suicide attacks.There will be far fewer flights than normal when it reopens, and tighter security will be in place, but the airport operator said the aim was to return to full capacity by the summer.Feist said the airport had planned three flights for the first day, to Faro, Athens and Turin, all operated by Brussels Airlines.The airport says it aims to return to maximum capacity before the start of summer holidays at the end of June or early July, with some check-in desks restored in the departure hall, followed by a full reopening of that space.Salah Abdeslam, the Paris attacks suspect who was arrested in Brussels last month, refused to blow himself up on the day of the attacks, his brother Mohamed told French news channel BFM TV.Abdeslam, who will be extradited to France, has renewed an offer to cooperate with French authorities investigating the Nov. 13 attacks that killed 130 people, his lawyer said this week.“There would have been more victims had I done it,” Salah Abdeslam told his brother.After his arrest in Brussels on March 18, Abdeslam answered some investigators’ questions but then exercised his right to silence following the suicide bombings in Brussels on March 22 that killed 32 people.Investigators believe the attacks in Paris and Brussels were carried out by militants from the same Islamic State network.Addressing the last nuclear security summit of his administration, President Obama warned that despite measurably reducing the risk of a devastating attack, the prospect of a terror group like the Islamic State obtaining nuclear weapons is “one of the greatest threats to global security.”“There is no doubt that if these mad men ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material, they would certainly use it to kill as many people as possible,” the president said, opening the last day of the international summit in Washington on Friday.Though Obama was determined to end the summit on a hopeful note, discussions among the dozens of world leaders that took place Friday were focused on Islamic terrorism, which followed Thursday’s conversations about the growing threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.Meanwhile, the U.S. and Japan are pledging to remove highly enriched uranium from a Japanese research reactor to reduce the risk of theft and nuclear terrorism.With the removal process now complete, the White House has stated that no Latin American state possesses more than one kilogram of highly enriched uranium, labeling Latin American and the Caribbean as a “region free of the material.”With its diverse landscapes and tax shelter, Belgium has long been known as a hotspot for European and international shoots, but the country has mostly been making headlines in the last few months for its nest of ISIS-trained jihadis who are behind the Paris and Brussels attacks.“Waltz With Bashir” director Ari Folman is preparing a TV series set in Brussels immediately after the four-day lockdown that authorities launched in November during a manhunt for the perpetrators of the Paris attacks.Among the films shooting in the capital on March 22 was Dany Boon’s “Raid Dingue,” an action comedy about France’s anti-terrorism squad, which was scheduled to shoot at Brussels airport shortly after the attacks.On the insurance front, companies such as Tokyo Marine, Circle, Axxa and Alliance, which handle film productions, have also been taking into account the risk of terrorist attacks in the wake of recent assaults across Europe.“Since the Paris attacks last November and more recently what happened in Belgium, we’ve been discussing with insurance companies to get them to adapt their services to these new terrorism risks.(Xinhua/Ye Pingfan)

BRUSSELS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Three of the nine people arrested in police raids Sunday were charged with participation in a terrorist group, the Belgian broadcaster RTBF reported Monday.The three people were identified as Yassin A., Mohamed B. and Abubaker O., for whom the Brussels investigating judge has already issued arrest warrants.Belgian federal prosecutor gave no additional information regarding the investigation.According to RTBF, the three people were believed to be involved in a new case, which was neither related to the Brussels explosions last week nor Paris attacks in November last year.The Belgian federal prosecutors confirmed in a statement on Sunday 13 raids took place in Belgium in the morning as part of an investigation against terrorism.A Belgian police officer stands guard during an anti-terror raid in the Schaerbeek - Schaarbeek district of Brussels, on March 25, 2016 (AFP Photo/Patrik Stollarz) More

Brussels (AFP) - Belgium raised the death toll from the Brussels attacks to 35 and charged three terror suspects Monday as police across Europe stepped up efforts to unravel an Islamic State network linked to the carnage.Police released a new video of a third suspect in the March 22 Zaventem airport attack, the so-called "man in the hat" seen with two other suicide bombers, who escaped after his bomb failed to explode.The man is thought to have been planning an attack in France in the name of the Islamic State group along with Reda Kriket, who was detained near Paris on Thursday, a French police source told AFP.Investigations continue into the core group of Brussels attackers, with police releasing video of a man in a hat and white jacket pushing a trolley with a large bag through the departure hall next to bombers Ibrahim El Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui.Prosecutors are still working on the theory that the third man is Faycal Cheffou, an activist who was charged on Saturday with "terrorist murder" in relation to the airport attack, a source close to the inquiry told AFP.Belga named the man arrested as A. Abderrahmane who prosecutors had said on Saturday was being detained for a further 24 hours after being shot during a raid in the Brussels district of Schaerbeek.It said he was charged in connection with a related raid in France this week that authorities say foiled an apparent attack plot.The prosecutor's office could not immediately be reached for comment.BRUSSELS, March 26 (Reuters) - Belgian federal prosecutors on Saturday said a man named as Faycal C had been charged with participation in a terrorist group, terrorist killings and attempted terrorist killings.They also said a second man Aboubakar A. Had also been charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group.Belgian police have released a man that they had initially charged with "participation in a terrorist group" and "terrorist killings" in connection with the Brussels attacks on the same day that they revealed new CCTV footage of another suspect.Faycal C, who was the only person charged in connection with last week's attacks, was released due to "lack of evidence", prosecutors said.It comes as US Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump warned Britain and Europe are "not safe" following the recent terror attacks.While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been leading a campaign against the Iran nuclear deal, IDF Intelligence has pointed to possible benefits to Israel as a result of the agreement.The IDF Military Intelligence Directorate's Research Department recently presented its stance on the deal to the political leadership, and along the risks and problems – which Israel has pointed out many times – it mentions a number of opportunities and positive possibilities that the deal can lead to.While noting that the risks are greater than the rewards, Military Intelligence emphasized the possible positives that could come of the deal.The Research Department went on to say that the deal might also rein in Iran and stop it from performing terrorist acts against Israel, such as bombing embassies.Alongside that, Military Intelligence also presented the risks involved in the deal, among them the fear of a nuclear arms race in the region, which could include countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt.The language that would require social media sites to alert authorities if terrorists are talking is in a bill that just cleared committee, Reuters reports.The actual requirement reads:

In plain English, that means that the defined set of services — which include all the big social media sites and networks like Twitter and Facebook — would be legally obliged to tell law enforcement ASAP if anyone making terroristic threats or talking about illegal “explosives, destructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction” floated across their networks.In a committee hearing about the bill yesterday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that social media companies should work with the government to prevent violent militants from using their sites.The bill does specifically say that nothing in it should be construed to read as a requirement for sites to monitor particular users or their communications, as a “protection of privacy,” so it’s not that Twitter or Facebook would suddenly start intently watching each and every one of their 236 million or 1.44 billion respective active users.A Facebook representative told Reuters, “We share the government’s goal of keeping terrorist content off our site.Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday called terrorists "gyaani" (learned) and suggested that they should do yoga in order to channelise their knowledge towards constructive work in the society.Singh, whose ministry is entrusted with the job of ensuring internal security, also asked political parties not to create controversy over the International Yoga Day, to be celebrated across the country and abroad tomorrow.Singh said yoga connects people to people, religion with religion and culture with culture.About 40,000 people are expected to be part of the International Yoga Day celebrations at Rajpath in New Delhi on Sunday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in his address to the UN General Assembly last year appealed to the international community to choose a day that could be observed as International Yoga Day.Speaking informally to media representatives in Islamabad, the foreign secretary said it is too early to say that Daesh was involved in yesterday’s terror attack in Karachi.—AP/File

Sunday’s attack in Lahore was the deadliest bombing targeting Pakistan’s Christians since more than 100 parishioners were killed at Peshawar’s All Saints Church in August 2013.Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesperson for the group, which sees all non-Muslims as potential targets, said the attack was calculated to show that they still retained the ability to strike deep into Pakistan’s heartlands — particularly Lahore — the political base of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.Read More: Facebook Apologizes for Worldwide Security Checks After Pakistan Bomb Blast

For terrorist groups like Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which has cells throughout Punjab, attacks like Lahore’s Easter Sunday bombing are far easier to mount than against military troops in Pakistan’s tribal areas.The attack comes at a time when the Pakistan government is facing a different threat from religious extremists.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to eradicate radical ideologies from Pakistan after a Taliban suicide bomber targeted many women and children celebrating Easter Sunday at a park in one of its biggest cities.Sharif has sought to take on Pakistan’s conservative elements in recent months, calling for better treatment of women and executing a man who assassinated a former governor for seeking a review of a blasphemy law.Sharif, who took power in 2013, termed the attack as cowardly and said it was a reaction to the government’s success in the fight against terrorism.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Nawaz Sharif on Sunday and "underlined the need for uncompromising efforts to fight against terrorism," foreign office spokesman Vikas Swarup wrote on Twitter.Sunday’s attack was Pakistan’s deadliest since 2014, when the Taliban massacred about 150 -- mostly students -- in their school, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal.Rather than just getting theological and political messages from television or the Internet, people who are part of religious institutions are more likely to hear a message that is rooted in the realities of American life.This doesn’t surprise Abdullah Antepli, chief representative of Muslim Affairs at Duke University, because “almost all mosques function as a civic and cultural center more than anything else.Through various religious, cultural, social, civic services, the mosques” help “many American Muslims’ [navigate] struggles to integrate into US society.”It’s unfortunate, then, that like other religious institutions, attendance at mosques hasn’t been strong.While churches and mosques may not advertise it, real religious education can provide young people with a kind of immunity to radicalization as well....Despite the pleas of Bill Maher on HBO's Real Time last night, Senator Corey Booker of New Jersey declined to utter the words that seem so taboo for the Democrats.I want to think about what's the American message in all of this and how are we going to defeat what we see is a determined enemy that is doing horrific things, not just to the United States, not just to Europe, we have a lot of attention on things that happened this week but just today there were people killed in Iraq at a soccer game.And so that's not a sound bite...

The term "violent extremism" at the tail end of Booker's rambling reply set Maher off with this:

MAHER: But see, wait.I think the Democrats risk losing this election if they cannot put together the words "Islamic extremism" as opposed to "violent extremism.”Towards the end of the interview, Maher pleads with Booker to just say "Islamic extremism" but to no avail.To our readers: The future of the Supreme Court.The most far-right presidential candidates in decades.Never has the work of Right Wing Watch, a project of the People For the American Way dedicated to exposing the Far-Right's extreme and intolerant agenda, been more important.And, as a non-profit, our main source of support is readers like you.If you use Right Wing Watch, please consider making a contribution to support our work at this critical time.Secretary of State John Kerry participates in wreath-laying with a firefighter at Brussels Airport in Brussels, Belgium, Friday, March 25, 2016, paying his respects to victims of terrorist attacks that left more than 30 dead at Brussels Airport.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool)

BRUSSELS (AP) — At least two Americans have been confirmed killed in the Brussels attacks, the State Department said Friday, as top U.S. diplomat John Kerry visited the stricken city to express condolences and defended Belgium's counterterrorism efforts against "carping" by critics.Kerry did not offer specific details, but the State Department later confirmed that the families of two Americans had been informed of their deaths in the attacks Tuesday.Visiting the Belgian capital on a hastily arranged stop, Kerry said all governments must consistently improve their strategies to fight terrorism, but maintained that Belgium had made significant improvements over the past year despite failing to stop Tuesday's attacks.Kerry said that prior to the recent attacks, the U.S. and other countries had already scheduled a number of meetings with Belgium about specific improvements they could make to their laws, intelligence collection and attempts to blunt the radicalization of youth in particular.They named the business ISIS Group Australia - known to most as simply ISIS.But by this year the company had realised the name ISIS was damaged.Shape chief executive Michael Barnes said the emergence of the ISIS extremist group had made it untenable to continue to trade under the same name."For some time we have become increasingly concerned with the potential safety and reputational risks of sharing a name with the militant group commonly referred to as ISIS, an acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.The Daily Mail Australia reported last month the community in the tiny Queensland locality of Isis - where people could gamble, drink beer and swim in bathers like other Australian towns - were happy with the name of their home town.The government is setting up a new hub for Britain's cybersecurity startups next to spy agency GCHQ in Cheltenham as part of its National Cyber Security Plan, which aims to counter terrorist groups like ISIS (also known as Islamic State) and other online criminals.The Cyber Innovation Centre, announced by Chancellor George Osborne today during a speech at GCHQ — Britain's "listening post" — will house and support security-focused startups "in their early months."Osborne revealed UK intelligence agencies are now developing techniques that will allow them to launch "offensive" cyber attacks on terrorists for the first time, while The Telegraph suggests that UK spies will be permitted to launch cyber attacks on "individual hackers, criminal gangs and rogue states as well as jihadists."He said the government will create a new £165 million Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund to "support innovative procurement" across both defence and cyber security.And government, from our military and GCHQ to the Government Digital Service and the NHS, need to be able to procure excellent cyber security hardware and services."Hamas welcomed the decision by Egypt, which faces an Islamist insurgency it says is fuelled by weapons smuggled from Gaza.— Reuters/file

Bernie Sanders brought his "political revolution" to big rallies in Appleton and West Allis Tuesday, while Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton went to an inner-city Milwaukee church to confront the pain inflicted by gun violence.Sanders, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont, and Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, are locked in a battle for 86 elected delegates and 10 superdelegates at stake in the April 5 primary.Sanders laid out his platform, contrasting himself not just with Clinton, but with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.But her most emotional event occurred at Tabernacle Community Baptist Church in Milwaukee, where she led a forum about gun violence prevention.■Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton called for tighter gun laws during an emotional appearance at Tabernacle Community Baptist Church in Milwaukee while independent Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders carried his populist message to overflow crowds in Appleton and West Allis.In Kansas that day, a white motorcyclist assaulted a Bangladeshi student (Wichita State’s student-body vice president) and his Hispanic friend, shouting: “Trump will take our country from you guys!”Wallace roused his crowds against left-wingers in the same way Trump turns his followers’ rage against Muslims and immigrants.When Trump says that “the police are the most mistreated people in this country,” he channels Wallace, who argued that the Supreme Court had “handcuffed” the cops with Miranda v. Arizona and other decisions.Nixon and Wallace together won 64 percent of the white working-class vote.Once in power, Nixon finished off Wallace as a political force by doing what his silent majority wanted: With the help of a compliant press, he pushed Vietnam off the TV screen by claiming he was phasing out the war and by bringing home some American troops even as the bombing increased and casualties mounted.Voters Fear More Political Violence, Blame Trump

Voters strongly believe candidates should tell it like it is, but most expect an increase in political violence this year, thanks in large part to Donald Trump’s unvarnished populist message.A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 61% of Likely U.S. Voters believe there is a greater danger of political violence this election cycle compared to past presidential campaigns.Still, 83% of all voters believe it’s more important for political candidates to tell voters what they really think rather than make sure no one is offended by what they say.One-in-four voters (24%) say they have attended or are likely to attend an event held by a presidential candidate this year.Sixteen percent (16%) of blacks and 23% of other minority voters say it is more important for a candidate to make sure no one is offended by what he or she says.Last August, the Boston Globe described what happened to a 58-year-old Latino man who was ambushed by two white men as he slept: "The homeless man was lying on the ground, shaking, when police arrived.When asked about the Boston hate crime, Trump didn't immediately condemn it.At a high school in Indiana last month, students sought to intimidate their opponents by chanting "Build a wall; build a wall" during a basketball game against a school with a heavy Latino student body.Violence also has erupted repeatedly at Trump rallies.In Louisville, for example, African-American protesters were forcibly ejected from a rally this month after Trump reportedly pointed at them and yelled, "Look at these people.Many Americans are increasingly fearful of what the violence that is increasingly linked to Donald Trump's campaign events portends for the Republican convention and the 2016 general election for president, even as Trump and his followers revel in the mayhem and publicity.The situation is rendered more disastrous for the Republican Party because the only candidate who seems to have any chance of beating Trump – Senator Ted Cruz – is seen by the establishment as just as scary.Ultimately candidates like Trump and Cruz are creations of the very Republican Party that is now terrified of their power and influence.There are few guides and it is quite possible that a party unable to co-ordinate a plan to stop Trump despite the existential threat he poses to it might not be able to organise a coherent brokered convention.Instead they have triggered a revolt of their voters, enabled Trump – a disruptive candidate who is not a conservative and barely a Republican – to emerge as their leader, and potentially signalled the end of the party of Lincoln.But in a country with the traumatic legacy of the Idi Amin dictatorship and the civil war that propelled Museveni to power in 1986, the concerns of many voters were encapsulated by Sophie, a 21-year-old restaurant assistant in Kampala.Mbabazi said the police were trying to influence the results of Thursday’s elections, while Besigye said Museveni was panicking after smelling defeat.But with nearly 60% of the population born after Museveni took power, the political capital from the absence of war in most of Uganda appears to be waning.Besigye, facing Museveni for the fourth time, has accused the president of presiding over corruption, personalising the country’s institutions, and buying weapons to retain power.Besigye and Mbabazi have retorted by warning of dire consequences if Museveni tries to rig the elections.(RELATED: 15-Year-Old Refugee Brutally Kills His Swedish Care Taker In Stabbing)

Government officials in the Nordic state have been quick to blame the “far-right” for the violence and have taken the incident as proof for why criticism of migrants should not be tolerated.(RELATED: Refugee Gangs Sexually Assault Teenage Girls At Swedish Festival Two Years In A Row)

Naturally, the family of the slain Swedish woman which sparked the vigilante attacks didn’t blame nationalists for her murder — they blamed the politicians who let in the unvetted migrants.Government officials, police and major media outlets all tried to obscure the now-infamous New Year’s Eve migrant rape gang attacks because telling the truth would be “politically awkward.”(RELATED: German Police Allegedly Covered Up ‘Syrian Refugee’ Status Of NYE Sex Assault Perpetrators Because It Was ‘Politically Awkward’)

However, public anxiety over the incident has still not quelled and many Germans are outraged their government would show reluctance to tackle such abominable acts.Pennsylvania Congressman Pat Meehan has introduced legislation prohibiting President Obama from lifting sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program until that country compensates American victims of its state-sponsored terrorism.(RELATED: House Republicans Symbolically Reject Iran Deal)

The Justice for Victims Of Iranian Terrorism Act would halt the advancement of Obama’s proposed nuclear deal until Iran makes good on the $43.5 billion American courts have awarded to victims, “all of which has gone unpaid,” Meehan wrote in a Wednesday article.Iran, “has funded some of the world’s most violent Islamic terrorist groups and has left in its wake decades of bombings, hijackings, murders and kidnappings,” he continued.“Courts have found Iran complicit in some of the most horrific acts of terror in American history, including the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and the 9/11 attacks.”You can read the bill in its entirety on the House of Representatives website.Brent Staples makes good points about what Confederate statuary is really about, especially when we are talking about people like Nathan Bedford Forrest.Forrest presided over the 1864 massacre of Union soldiers, many of them black, at Fort Pillow in Tennessee.“As the Klan’s first national leader,” Mr. Hurst writes, “he became the Lost Cause’s avenging angel, galvanizing a loose collection of boyish secret social clubs into a reactionary instrument of terror still feared today.”If the statue was to an open racist, KKK founder, and commander during the Fort Pillow Massacre like Forrest, I don’t see any good reason to keep that statue up.We are turning a corner in the popular understanding of the Civil War as being about slavery and racism and eliminating statues honoring people like Forrest are an important part of that, especially since that’s where the energy and momentum is right now.Brent Staples makes good points about what Confederate statuary is really about, especially when we are talking about people like Nathan Bedford Forrest.Forrest presided over the 1864 massacre of Union soldiers, many of them black, at Fort Pillow in Tennessee.“As the Klan’s first national leader,” Mr. Hurst writes, “he became the Lost Cause’s avenging angel, galvanizing a loose collection of boyish secret social clubs into a reactionary instrument of terror still feared today.”If the statue was to an open racist, KKK founder, and commander during the Fort Pillow Massacre like Forrest, I don’t see any good reason to keep that statue up.We are turning a corner in the popular understanding of the Civil War as being about slavery and racism and eliminating statues honoring people like Forrest are an important part of that, especially since that’s where the energy and momentum is right now.NPR's Robert Siegel talks with Roberta Jacobson, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, who led the negotiations between the U.S. and Cuba.ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: 
    President Obama says he'll remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.JACOBSON: Well, I think that the decision the president made is a reflection of the facts, and it lifts some sanctions if Cuba were to be taken off the list.SIEGEL: Assuming that this removal of Cuba from the list goes through after the 45 days, what other obstacles stand in the way of upgrading the two countries' interests sections in Havana and Washington to true embassies?JACOBSON: Well, let me be clear that the process that the president sought to review the State Sponsor of Terrorism List was independent of the negotiations that we're having on reestablishment of diplomatic relations and opening embassies.And again we ask to no one on particular, what is Obama doing about Iran's nuclear weapons program?The State Department report said terrorist attacks occurred in 85 countries in 2012, most of them in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq.Middle East analyst Matthew Duss at the Center for American Progress links the recent increase of violence in Iraq with the unrest in Syria.Duss said the violence in Iraq is primarily a reflection of continuing political divisions, which are not addressed through appropriate political channels.The State Department report said any long-term effort to fight terrorism must include building the capabilities worldwide to counter ideology that fuels terrorism.The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department sees piracy as one of its top priorities.In a highly tainted news report the Assistant Sheriff claims a direct link between piracy,

profit could be much higher,” ABS-CBN’s senior reporter Henni Espinosa notes.The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, on the other hand, has also noticed the link with organized crime and terrorism.So are these really the evil drug lords or terrorists the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and ABS-CBN are referring to?The UK Government’s Technology Strategy Board has awarded £250,000 to the London-based anti-piracy outfit MUSO.Interestingly, a quick look at MUSO's clients shows that despite the public funding, the company's most prominent customers are not based in the UK.MUSO director Christopher Elkins is delighted with the news and says that the money will eventually benefit the UK tech sector and copyright holders.A quick look at MUSO’s top clients based on Google’s Transparency Report shows only foreign copyright holders.Another prominent associate of MUSO is the Russian social network VKontakte, who signed an agreement earlier this year allowing the UK company to monitor and report uploads of copyrighted material.The ultimate goal is to eradicate illegitimate sites providing illegal music and movie downloads.However, the act of sourcing and downloading this material costs movie and music industries millions, and in turn creates a legal headache for those caught violating copyright infringement.Instead of having to internally alter search results, demoting illegal sites, the internet search engine Google is considering instead to hit the root of the source of pirated material online by shutting off financing, reports BBC News.In a July 2012 commissioned report, both Google and PRS for Music reviewed potential methods for inhibiting copyright infringement.Data for “The Six Business Models for Copyright Infringement” was collected from companies like The British Recorded Music Industry (BPI) and The Publishers Association.While the home theatre experience rapidly approaches a point preferable for many to the average cinema

when the popular website Megaupload -- one of many consistently used to host copyright-infringing films -- was raided and shut down, but now a new study has prompted a new focus on the action's repercussions, mainly by suggesting that it is not the download itself, but the recipient's reaction to it that makes all the difference.While the home theatre experience rapidly approaches a point

victims of the recent earthquake and over in Spain, artists have performed to raise funds for a seriously ill boy.FIMI, the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana, represents around 2,500 companies producing and distributing music in Italy and has been quick to condemn the leak, claiming that file-sharers are downloading the song while essentially trying to avoid giving money to charity, something which I find a little hard to believe.“There are thousands of copies of the song and video made available on P2P networks with tens of thousands of illegal downloads every day,” said the secretary general of Federation Against Music Piracy, Luca Vespignani.Meanwhile, moving west to Spain, aggressive copyright group Spanish General Society of Authors and Editors has been up to its old tricks again and it clearly doesn’t mind ‘damaging a charity’.Here at TorrentFreak we have faith that people are still donating to the earthquake fund willingly too, P2P downloads or not, and they don’t need to be demonized or put under pressure by some copyright group to do so.Two of Al Qaeda's former explosives experts were just transferred out of Guantanamo Bay and sent to Senegal, the Defense Department confirmed Monday, marking the latest detainees to be shipped out of the prison camp despite the risk they could return to the battlefield.The two Libyan former detainees were separately listed as threats to U.S. interests in Department of Defense documents obtained by Wikileaks and The New York Times.The transfer of Ghereby and Umar reduces the Guantanamo detainee population to 89, according to the Department of Defense.“Detainee is a long-time associate of UBL and has affiliations to other senior Al Qaeda leaders and operatives including Ayman al-Zawahiri,” the report said.Ghereby, 55, has been involved in extremist activities since at least the mid-1990s and was “captured with a senior Al Qaeda leader after fleeing to Pakistan,” according to the DOD report.The spokesman for Al-Qaeda's Syrian group Al-Nusra Front has been killed alongside his son and 20 jihadists in an air strike.Rami Abdel Rahman from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said: 'Abu Firas al-Suri, his son and at least 20 jihadists of Al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa and jihadists from Uzbekistan were killed in strikes on positions in Idlib province.'Two other targets belonging to Al-Nusra and allied jihadist group Jund al-Aqsa in the north of Idlib province were also attacked, Abdel Rahman said, leaving many seriously wounded.On Wednesday, a drone strike near ISIS Syrian stronghold Raqqa killed Tunisian commander Abu al-Haija, according to the Observatory, the latest in a series of blows to the jihadists in recent weeks.The advance came after the Syrian army dealt ISIS a major blow on March 27 by retaking the ancient city of Palmyra, known as the 'Pearl of the desert'.The al-Shabab official, Hassan Ali Dhoore, was specifically targeted by U.S. forces for his alleged role in two separate attacks in the capital city of Mogadishu, according to a U.S. Defense Department statement Friday.The airstrike was sanctioned by and conducted in concert with the Somali government, and although additional details of the bombing were not immediately available, the Pentagon asserted that Dhoore's confirmed death deals "a significant blow to al-Shabab's operational planning and ability to conduct attacks against the government of the Federal Republic of Somalia, its citizens, U.S. partners in the region, and against Americans abroad."The news of Dhoore's demise comes about three weeks after another airstrike against the militant group, when up to 150 al-Shabab members were killed at a training camp in Somalia.Al-Shabab denied the U.S. account, but the Somali prime minister's office confirmed the airstrike.Al-Shabab, an Islamic extremist group of militants, has been terrorizing the region for about the past decade and typically targets the Somali government, as exemplified by Thursday's suicide bombing that took place as the assailant hugged a local official.Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of once giving “tacit support” to Al Qaeda by a leading Labour grandee after it emerged he voted against banning the group from Britain just six months before 9/11.Charles Clarke, a home office minister at the time of the move in early 2001, said the Labour leader and other Left-wing MPs had “given comfort” to those groups facing a ban by blocking the proposals.Mr Corbyn, then a backbencher, voted against listing 21 militant groups from around the world as terrorists and banning them from entering Britain.A newspaper linked to an al Qaeda affiliate reported over the weekend that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Donald TrumpCops shut down rappers’ anti-Trump music video shoot Cruz: 'White knight' nominee at GOP convention a 'pipe dream' Cruz to Megyn Kelly: Trump 'seems to have a problem with strong women' MORE would mark a “drastic change” in U.S. foreign policy should he be elected president.The report from the online al-Masra publication connected to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula offers a look into how the al Qaeda offshoot views the political campaign playing out in the U.S.The article compared Trump to Democratic front-runner, according to a SITE Intelligence Group translation published by The Wall Street Journal

“As for the victory of Hilary Clinton, it will be an extension of the policy of Obama and the Democrats in the region, while the victory of Trump will be a drastic change in American policy towards Muslims, since the hostility that Trump bears and the Islamophobia from which he suffers will have a huge impact in the conflict in the Middle East region and the Muslim countries in general,” the al-Masra outlet reported, according to the translation.The report said that while U.S. allies in the Middle East are apprehensive of the GOP front-runner, “some other observers see that Trump is the clearest in expressing the American opinion about Islam, but he lacks political experience,” according to the Journal.Trump's high profile in media has previously seen the businessman show up in material from militant groups, including as recently as last week when his image appeared in an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) video following the Brussels attack when he referred to the city as a “horror show.”A comprehensive report on the American presidential election published Saturday in al-Masra, an online publication connected to the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, predicted that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would emerge as their parties’ nominees.Mrs. Clinton would largely maintain President Barack Obama’s foreign policy, reporter Adil al-Ahmad wrote, while Mr. Trump would alter the nation’s direction, in a translation released Monday by SITE Intelligence Group.“As for the victory of Hilary Clinton, it will be an extension of the policy of Obama and the Democrats in the region, while the victory of Trump will be a drastic change in American policy towards Muslims, since the hostility that Trump bears and the Islamophobia from which he suffers will have a huge impact in the conflict in the Middle East region and the Muslim countries in general.”Of Bernie Sanders, the al-Masra report cited a recent MSNBC interview in which the Vermont senator said he would “achieve better results in the primary elections that take place in the western states, after he lost to Clinton in a number of the southeastern states.”And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the al-Masra report predicted, will “not finish the presidential race, like Sanders, while it is expected that Trump and Clinton will finish the final elections.”Jabhat al-Nusra have released a tribute video in honour of a British teacher who died fighting in Syria last November.Known only by his nom-de-guerre Abu Baseer al-Hindi, the British man is shown working as a frontline cameraman and fighting for the al-Qaeda affiliated group in north-western Syria.The video confirms he was a Londoner, with narrator Lucas Kinney, a fellow British Jabhat al-Nusra fighter, saying: 'Abu Baseer, as we knew him, came from central London.Before his death in November 2015, Abu Baseer oversaw two issues of the magazine, which included interviews with British and Australian Jabhat al-Nusra members.However the British fighter, nicknamed Wolf Man by his fellow fighters most likely due to his substantial beard, was best known for appearing in a two-minute jihadi propaganda video titled: 'A Moment in Ribaat: Standing Guard in the Way of Allah.'Also, in Nigeria, the president names hundreds of companies and senior officials who embezzled funds under the previous leadership.And security

carried out an airstrike in Yemen on Tuesday that killed dozens of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) fighters, the Pentagon said.“We continue to assess the results of the operation, but our initial assessment is that dozens of AQAP fighters have been removed from the battlefield,” Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a written statement late Tuesday.“This strike deals a blow to AQAP's ability to use Yemen as a base for attacks that threaten U.S. persons, and it demonstrates our commitment to defeating al-Qa'ida and denying it safe haven.”The strike targeted a training camp in the mountains that was being used by more than 70 fighters, according to the statement.Tuesday’s strike against AQAP follows another high-casualty airstrike earlier this month that targeted the al Qaeda-linked al Shabab in Somalia.The U.S. military conducted an airstrike Tuesday against an Al Qaeda training camp in Yemen, causing dozens of casualties, a Pentagon spokesman said.Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said the training camp was located in the mountains, and was being used by more than 70 terrorists belonging to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).But Yemeni security officials and a witness said the airstrike hit a former military base that had been taken over by Al Qaeda militants about 47 miles west of the terror group's stronghold city of Mukalla."We continue to assess the results of the operation, but our initial assessment is that dozens of AQAP fighters have been removed from the battlefield," Cook said."This strike deals a blow to AQAP's ability to use Yemen as a base for attacks that threaten U.S. persons, and it demonstrates our commitment to defeating Al Qaeda and denying it safe haven," Cook said.A while back, we noted a report showing that the “sneak-and-peek” provision of the Patriot Act that was alleged to be used only in national security and terrorism investigations has overwhelmingly been used in narcotics cases.Now the New York Times reports that National Security Agency data will be shared with other intelligence agencies like the FBI without first applying any screens for privacy.FBI agents don’t need to have any “national security” related reason to plug your name, email address, phone number, or other “selector” into the NSA’s gargantuan data trove.That means information the NSA collects for purposes of so-called “national security” will be used by police to lock up ordinary Americans for routine crimes.And it certainly isn’t the only time that that national security apparatus has let law enforcement agencies benefit from policies that are supposed to be reserved for terrorism investigations in order to get around the Fourth Amendment, then instructed those law enforcement agencies to misdirect, fudge and outright lie about how they obtained incriminating information — see the Stingray debacle.A while back, we noted a report showing that the “sneak-and-peek” provision of the Patriot Act that was

address, phone number, or other “selector” into the NSA’s gargantuan data trove.That means information the NSA collects for purposes of so-called “national security” will be used by police to lock up ordinary Americans for routine crimes.And it certainly isn’t the only time that that national security apparatus has let law enforcement agencies benefit from policies that are supposed to be reserved for terrorism investigations in order to get around the Fourth Amendment, then instructed those law enforcement agencies to misdirect, fudge and outright lie about how they obtained incriminating information — see the Stingray debacle.On the one hand, I guess it’s better that this new data-sharing policy is acknowledged in the open instead of carried out surreptitiously.On the other hand, there’s something even more ominous about the fact that they no longer feel as though they need to hide it.It’s all another sobering reminder that any powers we grant to the federal government for the purpose of national security will inevitably be used just about everywhere else.And extraordinary powers we grant government in wartime rarely go away once the war is over.And, of course, the nifty thing for government agencies about a “war on terrorism” is that it’s a war that will never formally end.I was honored yesterday to speak at Hillsdale College’s Kirby Center in Washington on the dangers posed to our national security by political correctness and the government’s willful blindness to Islamic supremacist ideology.My speech and some Q&A afterwards have been posted at Hillsdale’s website, here.Listen to Episode 432 of Slate’s The Gist: Subscribe in iTunes ∙ RSS feed ∙ Download ∙ Play in another tab Slate Plus members: Get your ad-free podcast feed.On The Gist, the daughter of

clearly a significant difference between domestic terrorism and international terrorism – or what we are now referring to as Islamic terrorism – and hate crimes and other criminal violent acts that get characterized as terrorism.Race and religion have wrongly become factors in the definition of terrorism in the public eye, says Daryl Johnson, a former DHS terrorism analyst whose 2009 report about right-wing domestic terror threats was rescinded by the agency after a backlash from conservatives.The root of it, Johnson explains, was that law enforcement was concerned that a viable, African-American candidate for president, combined with the poor economy and traumatized veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, could lead to racial or anti-government movements that could become domestic terror threats.The media and the political community, experts say, tend to take a different attitude towards domestic terrorism than the FBI, which is focused on investigating and prosecuting a case.The Patriot Act definition of domestic terrorism is subject to broad interpretation, calling it a case where someone threatens or intimidates others for a political end, putting people's lives at risk.What began as a protest event in support of Dwight and Steven Hammond (father-and-son ranchers who were convicted of arson) quickly shape-shifted into armed sedition, with something like 100 militiamen seizing the unoccupied headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.A report from The Oregonian sums up the details:“The Bundy family of Nevada joined with hard-core militiamen Saturday to take over the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, vowing to occupy the remote federal outpost 30 miles southeast of Burns for years.The Bundy clan made headlines in 2014 when Cliven Bundy ignored federal mandates and continued grazing his cattle on disputed lands.And thanks to the cavalcade of crackpots in conservative media, the imaginary hazards are everywhere.In any event, what’s happening in Oregon is a massive story.Translation: We’re breaking the law and we’re going to continue breaking the law, and if the authorities try to do their jobs, we’ll shoot them.This is not a peaceful protest, in other words.The reactions on right-wing talk radio this week, one can assume, will be either similarly muffled or largely supportive.That the media’s reaction to Oregon is mostly muted tells you everything you need to know about the double standards at work here.But Carlin is also on a broader mission:  to root out home grown extremists like Robert Dear, who confessed in open court to killing three at a Colorado Planned Parenthood women's health clinic in December, and Dylan Roof, who faces capital charges in the murders of nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston, SC, last summer."If the suspect were Muslim, I think we'd go very quickly to a definition of terrorism"--Charles Kurzman, UNC Chapel Hill

"Among domestic extremist movements inside the United States the white supremacists are among the most violent," said Carlin.In recent days and weeks, an armed right-wing militia has (currently) occupied the headquarters of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon; mosques around the country have been fired on, burnt or defaced; men described as white supremacists shot up peaceful protesters at a Black Lives Matter rally in Minneapolis (the accused shooter, Allen Lawrence Scarsella, 23, was charged with five counts of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of second-degree riot); several white supremacists were arrested in Virginia for allegedly plotting to blow up black churches and mosques; and heavily armed right-wing gunmen blocked the entrance of a mosque in Irving, Texas, holding banners that read,  "we are the solution to Islamic terrorism."--"I imagine that this is a hangover from the attacks of September 11, 2001"

Potok ,who tracks extremists for the SPLC, said time and time again prominent Republicans have downplayed the dangers posed by right-wing extremism.But it's not an organized effort like the Islamic State in the Levant --Sen Lindsey Graham on Dylann Roof

"According to one study of state and law enforcement, the group that they are most concerned about in terms of causing violence are the Sovereign Citizens," said John Carlin of the DOJ.Here is the NYPD report on home grown jihadists that some Muslim rights advocates don’t want you to see.Big Apple Mayor Bill de Blasio has until Friday to decide on requests by plaintiffs in three lawsuits about so-called police spying on Muslim communities to have the 2007 study removed from the NYPD website, according to the New York Post.And these are the people who claim the government is impeding freedom of worship and free speech when it sends undercover officers to mosques, including some with a history of breeding terrorism.Nevertheless, the NYPD ditched the surveillance program last year.But apparently the city is still considered guilty of thought crimes because the 2007 report, “Radicalization in the West: the Homegrown Threat,” which inspired the Muslim surveillance program, remains on the NYPD website.This CCTV image from the Brussels Airport surveillance cameras made available by Belgian Police, shows what officials believe may be suspects in the Brussels airport attack on March 22, 2016.REUTERS/CCTV/Handout via Reuters More

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian prosecutors on Monday released a man they had charged in connection with last week's deadly Brussels bombings, saying they did not have enough information to justify holding him.Belgian media had identified the man as Faycal Cheffou and a source close to the investigation had said officials believed he was the man caught in security camera footage at Brussels airport moments before two bombs exploded last Tuesday.A Europe-wide hunt for suspects has revealed links with the network that killed 130 people in Paris last November, as well as foiling a new potential attack on France last week, officials said.Dutch anti-terrorism police arrested a 32-year-old suspect on Sunday in Rotterdam on France's request, and Italy arrested an Algerian on Saturday suspected of having forged documents for militants linked to the Brussels and Paris attacks.The announcement was a major blow to an investigation that had netted half a dozen people charged with lesser offences in Belgium and others in the Netherlands, Italy and France, where officials said the same network had planned another attack.Belgian media had identified the man as Faycal Cheffou and a source close to the investigation had said officials believed he was the man caught in security camera footage at Brussels airport moments before two bombs exploded last Tuesday.A Europe-wide hunt for suspects has revealed links with the network that killed 130 people in Paris last November, as well as foiling a new potential attack on France last week, officials said.In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the United States had urged European officials to do a better job of sharing intelligence after the Paris attacks late last year.Dutch anti-terrorism police arrested a 32-year-old suspect on Sunday in Rotterdam on France's request, and Italy arrested an Algerian on Saturday suspected of having forged documents for militants linked to the Brussels and Paris attacks.During an interview on British television earlier today, Donald Trump said that, in the wake of Brussels, Muslims aren’t doing enough to report suspicious activity in their communities.He told Piers Morgan––who was defending Trump yesterday––that no one turned in one of the suspects, which he called “a disgrace.”He said there’s “very little assimilation” and some Muslim communities “want to go by their own sets of laws.”When Morgan asked him what he would say to British Muslims who think he’s bigoted, Trump said he respects Muslims, but lamented, “It’s like they’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage.So perhaps it’s no surprise that Trump yesterday echoed support for Ted Cruz‘s proposal to have law enforcement “patrol and secure” Muslim communities.Now the Communist Party has ordered one of its defense contractors to develop software that uses big data to predict terrorist activity.But the China Electronics Technology Group has been tasked with not just gathering this data, but also developing techniques and algorithms to use it to make predictions about future terrorist events.The Chinese government already has unparalleled and virtually unrestricted access to information about how its citizens make use of the internet, but this latest program takes things offline as well.The recent encryption key laws were swept in under the guise of counter-terrorism, and the same is true with this latest program.There is a Person of Interest feel to the idea of using patterns of activity -- movement of people, banks transactions, communications, etc -- to predict future events, and many will see this as little more than an attempt by the ruling Communist Party to quell uprisings and silence anti-government activities.Yemeni citizens Mahmud Umar Muhammad Bin Atef and Khalid Muhammad Salih Al Dhubyvwere sent to Ghana Wednesday, at which point the West African nation issued a statement saying the detainees “have been cleared of any involvement in terrorist activities, and are being released,” The Long War Journal reports.Rather, the Department of Defense simply approved Atef and Dhuby for transfer, which according to a report from the Guantanamo Review Task Force is not the same thing as being “released.”According to the 2010 report, the term transfer means former detainees still need to be subject to security measures, whereas release means exiting confinement without the need for the receiving country to continue monitoring the security environment.“It is important to emphasize that a decision to approve a detainee for transfer does not reflect a decision that the detainee poses no threat or no risk of recidivism,” the task force report notes, according to The Long War Journal.“Rather, the decision reflects the best predictive judgment of senior government officials, based on the available information, that any threat posed by the detainee can be sufficiently mitigated through feasible and appropriate security measures in the receiving country.”One wanted to return to fight, while the other plotted to provide support to ISIS, according to prosecutors:

Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab, 23, of Sacramento, Calif., was charged with making a false statement involving international terrorism; and Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan, 24, of Houston, was charged with attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State.“Jayab allegedly traveled overseas to fight alongside terrorist organizations and lied to U.S. authorities about his activities,” said John Carlin, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.Jayab may have other legal issues facing him as well, according to this Fox News report, such as war crimes:

Social media and other accounts say that as soon as he arrived in the United States, he began saying he wanted to return to Syria to “work,” which the FBI says is believed to be a reference “to assisting in and supporting violent jihad.”The Washington Post also reports on the Obama administration’s press on Silicon Valley today for more cooperation in the war on terror:

The meeting at a federal government building in San Jose, to be led by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, follows President Obama’s televised call after the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month for tech leaders to “make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.”The proximity of Jayab to the “bull session” might make for a very good opening for a discussion about federal priorities, especially with the Obama administration proposing to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the US this year.The FBI investigators in San Bernardino held a press conference today outlining their progress on Tracking the activity of the terrorists, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik on December 2nd.Within the presser the FBI are seeking help from anyone who can assist them in filling in an 18 minute time-gap from 12:59pm to 1:17pm on December 2nd (see video):

It is great news to hear the FBI have accounted for much of the critical three-and-a-half hours many of us have discussed consistently from the outset.From the presser and subsequent Q & A, the FBI detail a very specific geography of travel by the terrorists.Interestingly, neither Syed or Tashfeen appeared to be trying to escape the regional geography in/around the Inland Regional Center.Anyone who can assist the FBI to fill in those missing 18 minutes is urged to contact the regional FBI office at 1-800-225-5354 and select option #4.A study conducted by the New York Times found that the Islamic State is “astonishingly successful” at spreading their message and recruiting followers on social media, especially Twitter, even amid the network’s past efforts to thwart the activity.“The updated language emphasizes that Twitter will not tolerate behavior intended to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence another user’s voice,” the new policy reads.In past policy memos, Twitter has said it would block the promotion of terrorism and violence, but the network had no regulations in place that would allow it to ban people who tweeted “hateful” posts.Additionally, Twitter will now ban users from creating multiple accounts in an effort to avoid suspension — a tactic which has been used effectively by terrorists seeking to remain on the social media site.Over the past year, both Facebook and Twitter have worked to adjust their policies in order to quash terrorist activity online.Frank Montoya Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI’s Seattle office, said his agents have “more than 70, but less than 100” active terrorism investigations going.The head of Seattle’s FBI office on Friday put out a plea for people across the region to notify officials if they suspect possible terrorism activity.During a news conference, Frank Montoya Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI’s Seattle office, said his agents have “more than 70, but less than 100” active terrorism investigations going.During the hourlong news conference, Montoya said the FBI is working hard to develop relationships in Muslim and immigrant communities locally, but he said agents still need help from people who have seen anything suspicious.Special agent Kera O’Reilly, during the news conference, added that in the case of the San Bernardino attacks, people saw suspicious behavior from the two suspects beforehand but didn’t notify authorities.Boston police were preparing a training exercise for right-wing terrorism when a couple of Muslims ruined the narrative by planting and detonating real bombs.From The Boston Globe via Jihad Watch:

The scenario had been carefully planned: A terrorist group prepared to hurt vast numbers of people around Boston would leave backpacks filled with explosives at Faneuil Hall, the Seaport District, and in other towns, spreading waves of panic and fear.Months of painstaking planning had gone into the exercise, dubbed "Operation Urban Shield," meant to train dozens of detectives in the Greater Boston area to work together to thwart a terrorist threat.But two months before the training exercise was to take place, the city was hit with a real terrorist attack executed in a frighteningly similar fashion.The chaos of the Boston Marathon bombings disrupted plans for the exercise, initially scheduled for this weekend, forcing police to postpone.Two former intercept officers who worked at the NSA facility in Fort Gordon, Georgia told ABC News’s Brian Ross in 2008 that they and their colleagues listened in on phone calls home of hundreds of Americans living and working abroad.“These were just really everyday, average, ordinary Americans who happened to be in the Middle East, in our area of intercept, and happened to be making these phone calls on satellite phones,” Adrienne Kinne, one of the whistle-blowers and a former Army Reserves Arab linguist, told ABC News.The calls, according to Kinne, were “personal, private things with Americans who are not in any way, shape or form associated with anything to do with terrorism.”He said that he and his colleagues listened in on the calls of American officers living in the Green Zone in Baghdad.Faulk described the personal nature of many of the calls, and how he and his colleagues would encourage each other to listen into a call where “there’s good phone sex” or “some colonel making pillow talk.”posted at 2:41 pm on May 6, 2013 by Allahpundit

The Tsarnaevs wanted to kill people, whereas the Weather Underground mostly wanted to blow up property except for that time they built nail bombs to kill soldiers at a dance at Fort Dix but ended up blowing themselves up instead.One: Ayers doesn’t attempt to defend the Tsarnaevs’ motive, even though it was anti-war of a sort.There is no relationship at all between what Weather Underground members did and the bombings that two brothers allegedly committed on April 15 in Massachusetts, Ayers said in response to a reporter’s question.No one died in the Weather Underground bombings… In his talk to the crowd, Ayers mentioned that in 1970, he lost three friends in the Weather Underground, including his lover, Diana Oughton.Telling the crowd the circumstances of those deaths would have been “inappropriate,” Ayers said afterward.
